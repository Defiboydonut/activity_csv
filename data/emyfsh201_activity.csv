2023-10-27 22:21:49,Comment,1,How long does it normally take after snapshot for distribution?
2023-10-27 22:20:02,Comment,1,Has tried unsuccessfully several times and then learn the hard way that you can't Time the market but you can be on time in the market.

2023-10-27 15:11:44,Comment,1,"Moons are currently at $0.067, did it go way beyond that figure earlier today?"
2023-10-27 04:19:43,Comment,1,Hacks are One of the impediments of crypto Mass adoption. Bad actors need to be fought seriously for this space to gain Masse's trust.

2023-10-25 20:32:20,Comment,2,This looks like the actual difference between moons and donuts
2023-10-25 20:28:57,Comment,2,It's beginning to look like moons failure is donuts success
2023-10-25 10:21:28,Comment,1,I think it'll remain in the middle.
2023-10-25 03:23:31,Comment,2,Reddit provides the csv files for karma.

2023-10-25 03:18:47,Comment,3,I see! It's even better now that Reddit has nothing to do with it
2023-10-25 03:15:02,Comment,3,"Since Reddit plays a part in the distribution of donuts, how will it now be done since Reddit is taking their hands off RCPs?"
2023-10-25 03:12:18,Comment,2,"You can still connect your wallet using mobile on kiwi browser, I did it and it worked perfectly well.

2023-10-24 03:37:56,Comment,4,How long do you think this uptrend can sustain?
2023-10-23 18:11:42,Comment,1,I believe this sub exists to inform and educate people in issues like this. Some newcomers aren't aware of how tricky crypto can be if operated by bad actors so it's good these scams are exposed here for people to be aware.
2023-10-23 17:27:19,Comment,5,This sub seems more accommodating than the other subs though there are similarities.

2023-10-23 05:09:57,Comment,5,Is it the Bloomberg statement or another thing that's causing these pumps?

2023-10-22 13:13:10,Comment,1,Spot ETFs will be the catalyst for driving the price upwards to that level.

2023-10-22 08:03:06,Comment,6,Which exchanges are donuts listed?
2023-10-22 08:02:20,Comment,3,"Reddit didn't pay for those tokens there's no confirmation towards that, but I think the exchanges listed them on their own."
2023-10-22 04:57:58,Comment,3,The amount doesn't matter at all if he traded just before the announcement then it is what it is and that is insider trading.
2023-10-22 04:41:56,Comment,3,"I didn't know it was 2 mods thought it's One that later deleted his account, It's good for the space though"
2023-10-22 04:29:46,Comment,1,Yeah it revokes every permission I often use it and it works well.
2023-10-22 04:16:07,Comment,1,"If it can be put into vote, then good and fine as it might be a deterrent for similar future occurrences."
2023-10-22 04:04:53,Comment,1,"Even if the person(s) is/are from a region where the rules ain't clear about insider trading, they broke the trust of a thriving community and made a mess if a once promising project though inadvertently aided by Reddit, so I think there should be strict and clearer rules about the mods not shitting in people."
2023-10-22 03:56:03,Comment,2,"Very very wrong of Reddit to do so, they shouldn't have informed the mods ahead of others that would amount to giving them inside information and If they (Reddit) must tell the mods, they should have gotten assurance at least from the mods not to dump on us in exchange for the smart contract, that way there wouldn't have been much fiasco about all this."
2023-10-21 18:46:39,Comment,2,"That goes to justify the saying ""it takes a thief to catch a thief"" FBI now uses criminal mode to catch criminals, is it right to call that adaptability?"
2023-10-21 08:41:08,Comment,1,"I second this submission any mod that sold irrespective of the amount or quantity, using the inside knowledge they had before the dump should be removed as they can't be trusted anymore not to do the exact same thing again so I think the mods of this sub should investigate this allegation and if true then do the needful."
2023-10-21 04:28:15,Comment,1,"If the price increases, some will definitely be tempted to sell but some genuinely believe in the project so I doubt all of them would sell"
2023-10-21 04:10:35,Comment,1,I can't wait for both BTC and ETH spot ETF to be approved
2023-10-19 19:50:11,Comment,1,"So it's not even the Reddit announcement but the mods selling of moons that triggered the downfall of moons, greed is part of human nature"
2023-10-19 17:44:31,Comment,1,"It's reassuring to know that not all mods dumped their tokens, we still have some good guys around and my respect for them though they should have warned people earlier"
2023-10-19 16:13:15,Comment,1,Yeah agreed The only one that didn't shake much was donut probably cos it's independent of Reddit and this fiasco highlighted the importance of decentralization and not trusting big cooperations.
2023-10-19 05:11:53,Comment,1,"Good bot steals from bad guys who steals from ordinary people, was this bot lurking around waiting for the scammer to make his move and then pounced on him or did the bot happened to be at the right place at the right time?"
2023-10-19 04:23:08,Comment,2,"I think the rules here are a bit modified than that of Rcc and I must say it's good especially for submitting posts, paying some fees to submit a post will result in high quality posts since no one will waste their time paying for a submission that will definitely be taken down so it makes perfect sense."
2023-10-18 15:11:25,Comment,2,"I mean Reddit could always have done better but they choose to go the Orwellian way instead, too bad they raised lots of hope only to bash them in the ground."
2023-10-18 14:32:53,Comment,2,So the downfall of moons is the uprise of donuts.
2023-10-18 07:26:13,Comment,2,That's 1/10000 chance
2023-10-18 07:21:56,Comment,1,Nah! It's gonna wreck your life if you have Hopes on them.
2023-10-18 07:05:47,Comment,6,"It turns out that every coin that ends with moon ends up wrecking people, Reddit just confirmed it."
2023-10-18 03:27:09,Comment,2,"It's so unfortunate that no body Saw this coming, Reddit literally rugpulled everyone when no one was least expecting it though, we should have seen it after the introduction of the contributor program.

2023-10-11 05:40:20,Comment,2,Oh I see! Previous ones won't count.
2023-10-11 05:37:09,Comment,2,So what happens to previously earned karma before I connect my wallet?  Will it count once I connect my wallet os how is it done?

If they continue attacking and disregarding crypto, they may end up being the last man in the crypto race."
2023-10-09 05:52:59,Comment,1,Reducing the entry barrier to minimum cam play a major role in making staking accessible to more people and centralization wouldn't be an issue.
2023-10-07 18:11:52,Comment,1,Dude might have realized that it'll be hard to launder the stole funds given to recent happenings so it's better to return them and get compensated than having to look back over his shoulders for the rest of his life.
2023-10-07 08:53:35,Comment,1,"Does that equate to dumping the dollar cos If it is, then we're going into interesting times."

2023-10-01 17:43:15,Comment,1,I strongly believe we can.
2023-10-01 17:42:16,Comment,2,"Though I'm optimistic about Ethereum's future, I don't think ETH is going to displace Bitcoin any time soon, might be possible in the future but for now, it's a long call."
2023-10-01 17:38:50,Comment,4,"I don't think there'll be a steep rise, as the hype increases the price will rise maybe we'll cross the $1700 mark to possibly $1800-$1900 or close to it and then when the hype dies down, the price will revert to around $1700-$1800"
