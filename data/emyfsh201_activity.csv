2023-10-19 16:13:15,Comment,1,Yeah agreed The only one that didn't shake much was donut probably cos it's independent of Reddit and this fiasco highlighted the importance of decentralization and not trusting big cooperations.
2023-10-19 05:11:53,Comment,1,"Good bot steals from bad guys who steals from ordinary people, was this bot lurking around waiting for the scammer to make his move and then pounced on him or did the bot happened to be at the right place at the right time?"
