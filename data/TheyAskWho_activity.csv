2023-10-25 10:51:25,Comment,2,"Isn’t something I would personally use, I couldn’t trust my seed phrase being stored on the cloud and especially while it requires to restore through ID, but I do see this possibility being a good solution for older people that are into crypto or someone with bad bad memory. I rather keep my seed phrase safe myself and if in worst case scenario something happens, I can blame myself but it would be worse if the company or cloud gets compromised I feel that would be more painful, when you put all your trust in one company."
