2023-09-30 10:47:06,Comment,1,"If there is less of something, it becomes more scarce, more scarce whilst still having the same/if not more demand, makes price go up. Now ETH had an upgrade last year (or year before iirc) eip1559 upgrade which make ETH from proof of work to proof of stake to help run the network. In turn this burns ETH, and sometimes (but not always) burns more ETH than is produced, making it deflationary at times, with the main goal/hopefully be more deflationary than inflationary in the long run. Making ETH more scarce."
