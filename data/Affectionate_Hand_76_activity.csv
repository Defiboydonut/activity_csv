2023-10-27 16:26:19,Comment,yes i agree but the price needs to stay constant after pumping . It needs to stay constant for multiple days so it can be dumped.,2
2023-10-27 16:17:54,Comment,"Even if they hype and people FOMO .people with huge bags cant sell without bringing price down.

its a pump i agree but the dump is more due to multiple people who have sold as opposed to 1 selling as they were inable to sell the first time.",2
2023-10-27 16:10:33,Comment,"People dont understand pump and dump. Moons are difficult to pump and dump. The pump needs to sustain for longer periods to enable them to sell. üò™

For god sake please understand it. If you are responsible for a 100 % pump. you need to understand that if they pump doesnt sustain for more than 10 minutes the person who pumped will loose most money if he dumps.

if they pump and sell it after it reaches 100 % they will be loosing it more than 10 % value . Its low liquidity basic economics. 

And people are upvoting this nonsense.",6
