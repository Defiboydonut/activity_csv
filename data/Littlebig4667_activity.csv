2023-10-27 18:23:13,Comment,1,Scammer season is upon us again but I’m more prepared this time…I think!
2023-10-27 18:20:57,Comment,1,"Only Elon can say what he’s up to and whatever it is it will start something big that will in all probability be pulled back. 
He’s an ideas man that bounces them off walls everywhere until 1 sticks"
2023-10-27 18:12:29,Comment,2,I’ll do both 👍
2023-10-27 18:05:00,Comment,2,"I’ll buy donuts this week and then forget until the awakening, or get that fuddle brain forgetting disease and die a millionaire without knowing"
2023-10-27 10:52:00,Comment,1,DCA is the way to go most times but more so in the bear. Do the math and reap the rewards & repeat

2023-10-26 21:04:24,Comment,1,Wouldn’t expect anything less from his mouth
2023-10-26 17:29:29,Comment,1,"Isn’t this the buy low sell high we all talk about? It’s just someone making profit in a way we all should, but don’t want it happening to our donuts. 
They will get caught short at some point"
2023-10-25 19:59:16,Comment,2,World governments are not happy 1 bit but they have never been or ever will be
2023-10-25 14:20:59,Comment,2,There’s always a way in unfortunately. Those who benefit from deceitful actions have many faces
2023-10-24 21:54:05,Comment,0,Karma always remembers to pay s as visit to this kind of people
2023-10-24 19:31:03,Comment,3,The guys a dirtbag and falling hard from his false grace. Nothing good from here for him
2023-10-24 08:18:32,Comment,3,I’d vote up this all day long
2023-10-24 06:35:43,Comment,1,"Noticed this happening to myself at times, so hearing this leaves me thinking that there is an active party who is persistent & consistently downvoting to discourage others. 
I don’t think there’s even a reason why, maybe they get joy from it and that’s the simple reason"
2023-10-24 05:31:38,Comment,1,Common sense prevailed ✌️
2023-10-22 17:00:50,Comment,1,"The idea is appealing and obviously there are many more Q & A that people want to be involved in, but as an idea I think it has merit to feel for the wider community vote"
2023-10-22 09:14:53,Comment,2,"I’ll simply assume they were warned ahead of time, as a nod of respect for being ‘Mods’. 
It don’t make it right in any way, but they know in time it’ll be just a whisper in the wind from the ‘old folk’ OG’s who were here and paid the price for trusting them. 
I’ll even go as far as saying some mods were chosen over others 1st to dump their bags and they had their own internal war over it. Either way it was a blatant rug pull of the highest order 😤"
2023-10-21 22:16:42,Comment,2,"There’s money to be made on any event, kudos to the profiter of this ✌️here is a lesson for life for us all"
2023-10-21 17:18:17,Comment,1,"I think they are a 🛎️ end for not selling for the 5,000 ETH when it was originally offered."
2023-10-21 14:38:52,Comment,1,The FUD will begin a landslide given past similar pegs. This will be interesting to watch
2023-10-21 14:36:21,Comment,2,"And it can never be the same again after the trust was smashed against a wall, at least here it is very much different and trust is part of the deal"
2023-10-21 11:38:47,Comment,1,I’m shedding a happy tear for that wallet owner
2023-10-21 09:00:13,Comment,1,It was the act that needs addressing not the amount. They did it and are therefore guilty of it
2023-10-21 08:57:55,Comment,1,"Money laundering through various acts of illegal behaviour, then grassed up by the weakest link. What could go wrong 🤷‍♂️"
2023-10-21 08:54:25,Comment,1,Keep ya ETH & BTC and wait that 1 out. I can’t answer for the rest. Money maybe tight but unless your truly desperate I’d say hang in there
2023-10-20 18:41:19,Comment,4,A decent place to be without so much of the nonsense of other subs plus you get to chat ETH 💪
2023-10-20 14:45:30,Comment,2,"Being removed doesn’t affect them 1 bit, they’ll start again under another name. Reddit has fallen into the 💩 pit and before long new comers will not remember what it did to all the others by rug pulling them"
2023-10-19 17:44:10,Comment,1,The big shlong 🍌
2023-10-19 13:46:45,Comment,1,"Gas fee is next to nothing and bridging is pretty good too, I’m not surprised it had had a surge in investments and well worth testing the chain out to get a feel of it"
2023-10-19 12:58:34,Comment,2,"Lots of profanity going on there dude! And you sound very angry, I don’t think I want to discuss ETH with you much"
2023-10-19 09:58:46,Comment,1,WTF! The bots 🤖 are taking over and scamming the scammers 🥹 now’s that’s a strange kind of beauty going on there
2023-10-19 06:49:34,Comment,2,"I’ve never been more bullish on donuts now Moons have been sidelined by Reddit. 
A sizeable number of moon holders will transfer over to this side of the fence and gain strength in our numbers"
2023-10-18 20:12:51,Comment,1,They handed out the life jacket’s then jumped before sounding the alarm! That’s a classic rug pull done with a smile on their faces and don’t even have to hide from what they did to everyone 😤
2023-10-18 13:15:17,Comment,2,"I see good things from here on in as the moon crew join forces with the donut brigade 🫡 
Everyone is welcome & quite frankly we all need each other in this space for growth"
2023-10-18 11:20:40,Comment,2,"Donuts were 0.0006 not long ago so where it is now is a far sight better than expected given the rug that just took place. 
It’s an opportunity to buy now for a good chance of a rise in the next bull run"
2023-10-18 09:04:43,Comment,1,I said yesterday that buying donuts now is an opportunity that we missed some time back. Load up and fingers crossed 🤞 time will heal everything
2023-10-18 08:49:22,Comment,1,Welcome everyone….Open the gates and come on in to the only place left that is transparent & won’t step on you whilst smiling
2023-10-18 08:06:29,Comment,2,$15 is actually a big lesson in following your own tick box ✅ ethos as it could have been so much worse
2023-10-18 08:03:36,Comment,8,"I thought at least Reddit was a safe area to put your faith in, but as shown they are no better than the scammiest scammer"
2023-10-18 05:59:48,Comment,1,"Let the storm pass by and wait for everything to settle. Nothing has really changed except people’s minds right now, but as will all things this too will pass and move on"
2023-10-17 21:50:58,Comment,2,Time to buy some donuts 🍩 imo. 4 x cheaper than last week Is 4 x more
2023-10-17 20:05:16,Comment,1,Even a bankrupt/liquidated company seems to be worth $Millions but it’s not their money and a kick in the teeth to those who lost it all
2023-10-17 16:29:08,Comment,1,"There’s no reason for me to doubt him on this, probably has enough to keep him going to not need to sell anything"
2023-10-17 09:03:38,Comment,2,Anyone guilty of identity theft deserves all they get for prison time. They wreck other people’s life and don’t give a care for any of it.
2023-10-16 22:50:43,Comment,1,So Elon has now franchised out 🤷‍♂️
2023-10-16 19:00:09,Comment,1,"It’s only dumb if you wait for that price but it never comes, more unfortunate than dumb. 
DYOR plays well but if you intention is to cash out in the next bull run then todays price is good to go for future profit."
2023-10-16 14:58:53,Comment,1,"Time to do a house clean of all your approvals that you no longer need/use from your wallet. 
I’ve periodically gone through my list and rescinded plenty, it may not stop this type of hack but it’s good practice all the same"
2023-10-16 14:53:43,Comment,1,"I get this glitch when flipping between chains, I always jump thinking someone mistakenly sent to the wrong address then it settles to reveal my $1.26 worth of ETH"
2023-10-16 11:20:37,Comment,1,"It would be funny if it wasn’t true, but it’s just funny to think it’s 100% true"
2023-10-16 11:17:43,Comment,1,"Watching my 110,000 Matic go from $0.13 to $2.98 but in full belief it would go to the $10 everyone was 1000% sure would happen, and anyone who sold now was an idiot….but the idiot was me listening to them all and watched it go down to $0.50 before I sold, in profit but kicking myself for listening to influencers"
2023-10-16 11:10:24,Comment,1,And it will no doubt be a mitigating factor his team will exploit throughout the whole case
2023-10-16 09:11:40,Comment,2,"Oh we have the mental health defence going on then! Sorry your honour but I was mentally unwell when I scammed everyone 🧐.
ADHD isn’t an excuse he can use and would be an insult to those who have it"
2023-10-16 08:59:46,Comment,1,Not gonna happen this month I feel maybe December but that’s my wishful thinking
2023-10-15 21:10:03,Comment,1,"It fits her narrative to go with an emotive provocation to gain support for her aim, and it may very well succeed unfortunately"
2023-10-15 17:09:54,Comment,2,"BTC & ETH are like gold & silver, each precious but one is a use and sometimes unrecoverable asset (burnt ETH in this scenario). 
Both are worth holding all day long"
2023-10-15 15:32:32,Comment,1,"Life can be hard for anyone even in wealthy countries, so this is mind boggling to me and I truly couldn’t imagine that situation they are going through. 
I’d say cryptocurrency is the answer assuming they have access, but even then you need to cash out via a bank, at least that’s how it is in my country"
2023-10-15 15:22:58,Comment,3,"I’ve noticed tx fees are lower than they used to be but my time zone seems to align with busy periods on the chain when I want to make transfers. 
$0.19 for that kind of transfer is liquid gold & 100% the reason why banks are worried including governments. They like to know where your money is, and want it in their hands."
2023-10-15 15:16:00,Comment,1,"0.44% is something to behold if your an ETH holder, unlike a few coins I have which have a variable inflation ranging from 11-18% inflationary minting annually. 
The minting does drop year on year but it’s still too high and I just hope they are worth holding for next bull run. Next bear I’m going all in on ETH and sit back and relax"
2023-10-15 15:04:50,Comment,1,"40x seems a reasonable & achievable target in that timeframe, if anything by my purchasing a small amount regularly 2043 will be a good year"
2023-10-15 13:20:13,Comment,2,"I’d imagine it would have been a huge temptation to keep the gains made from the scammer, plus there’s the ability to go to the dark side and become a scammer themselves for personal gain. I tip my hat to them"
2023-10-15 12:13:54,Comment,1,"BTC dominance will continue for a while to come and ETH will always be chasing its tail until then. 
Lowing gas fees will be the catalyst for exponential growth on Ethereum including clarity on regulation, but DCA ETH for the future is still a solid plan I’ll use, a bit here and there every so often"
2023-10-15 12:03:49,Comment,1,"BAYC went bananas then it slipped on its own tossed skin, money was definitely made but the losses were huge. 
I’ve a few different projects NFT’s in my wallet for nostalgia"
2023-10-15 11:53:20,Comment,2,I just sold and it’s about to pump so I’ll meet you in the middle
2023-10-15 10:08:42,Comment,2,"The five-fold is already an expected given in the next bull run but the $35,000 tag will take some time, if your flush & young enough it’s worth the investment to play the long game. 
Buy low in the bear & sell high in the bull seems a simple effective strategy but I’ve never mastered this simple trick myself"
2023-10-15 09:09:01,Comment,1,"I’ve some ETH shrapnel on a few addresses that would cost more to move than it’s worth right now, so I guess I’ll wait it out for 2035 or something"
2023-10-14 14:31:01,Comment,2,I’m going to have to go cold Turkey on this but I don’t have the willpower
2023-10-14 14:28:30,Comment,2,I’m pretty sure my bank uses my money and borrows it out for mortgages etc but apparently has assets to cover 🤔 FTX just abused everyone for its own greed and it’s going to look messy as hell once it’s all spilled out
2023-10-13 12:37:37,Comment,2,"I was too dismissive of cryptocurrency back then and ignorant to its usage, but hindsight is the price you pay for having closed eyes"
2023-10-10 06:35:36,Comment,2,"That’s a secure strategy to aim for and hoping to do similar for my kids but I have a bit of time on my hands given they are still young. 
I don’t want to even think about house prices in 15-20 years time, but I doubt it will be affordable so I’ll do my part to help them out as saving right now gets eaten away with inflation so ETH investment will be my goal"
2023-10-09 11:34:39,Comment,1,"Right now is about the best time to join into crypto. I recall watching from the sidelines 2017 but never did a thing until 2021, having taken a knock of 2 gained experience and although not a hardcore crypto trader I think the next bull run will see me ok to feel good about my decisions and hopefully keep going for the future"
2023-10-08 15:42:08,Comment,2,Crypto is the biggest threat to every financial institution going at present and eventually it will be crypto that takes the top spot as per evolution rules of dominance
2023-10-08 15:06:21,Comment,1,"Unfortunately it’s the only way to learn having been foolish during the last bull run I’ve certainly been taught a few lessons. 
Experience is just another word for mistakes made"
2023-10-08 11:59:06,Comment,1,We can’t say BTC on instagram? Hell that’s a harsh rule surely! Seems a bit draconian to me unless it’s those spam posts dragging fools into the lions cage
2023-10-08 11:46:23,Comment,1,"[NO] Just reduce ratio as comments can be of interest depending on the reader thou there are those that spam persistently. 
Often a 5 word comment is sufficient in context to a post so I disagree on those who state otherwise as it’s all relative and we are not expecting to philosophise every post"
2023-10-08 09:56:55,Comment,1,It will ebb & flow like the tide but when high tide comes it will be a welcome $2k
2023-10-08 09:44:00,Comment,2,J Sun just paid his own money back to himself
2023-10-08 09:40:22,Comment,4,"If these security vulnerabilities can be highlighted that result in greater security then white hat hacking is a welcome in my books. 
I’d rather it not be the case but I’m not sure if there’s another way to eradicate it. 
There will always be those who tinker away just because they can, and they will always test the limits if there is a financial gain to be made. 
Other platforms will shy away from sharing info if it gives their competitors an edge over them, but as a whole your idea of them do just that makes 100% sense for the common good"
2023-10-08 09:31:48,Comment,1,Saved this post to refresh ready for the next bull run 👍 thanks
2023-10-08 09:27:51,Comment,1,Being North Korean seems to be a profitable attribute at the moment

2023-10-08 07:25:20,Comment,1,"There’s always a way to circumvent sanctions as they are but a blunt tool to make A to B more difficult but not impossible. 
Regardless of your nationality, the average citizen is simply a pawn ♟️ on the political chessboard and will always pay the price for the actions of the player"
2023-10-07 21:33:21,Comment,1,Friend has just been UnFriended then
2023-10-07 17:26:15,Comment,1,"Righty ho! Then, since I’ve cracked my own password on my laptop I think I’m ready to make my fortunes as a white hat hacker, I’ve started by giving myself back my own $1.52 for a 10% bonus and I’m off to my kids piggy bank next 😎
Isn’t this what J Sun just did?"
2023-10-07 17:19:59,Comment,1,‘G’day ya dirty dingo you have the right to remain silent but anything you do say will be taken from you anyway’

2023-10-07 12:07:38,Comment,2,"It took me a while but I managed to withdraw all 110,000 in 23 hours then I woke up and went to work wondering what kind of dream that was lol"
2023-10-07 12:05:30,Comment,1,ETH will be around for a long time to come so maturing this way is exponentially important to maintain its position and relevance in this industry. I’d love to see a snapshot of the future 10 years from now
2023-10-07 08:50:00,Comment,1,It’s a happy/sad moment of ETH burning 🔥 happy it’s gone but sad it’s not mine
2023-10-07 08:37:09,Comment,2,There’s that for sure as I’m now basing my life on having the freedom to make financial decisions being central to my future and that of my children
2023-10-07 08:15:40,Comment,1,"The political box is full of self serving dinosaurs who don’t want anyone else having a say in the world, It needs a proverbial asteroid ☄️ to clear them out"
2023-10-06 18:05:01,Comment,1,BTC & ETH are safe bets at least in the next bull run to minimise risk and if time is on your hands then maybe branch out a little in the next bear to push further up the financial ladder
2023-10-06 18:03:21,Comment,1,A pump always results in a drop but as long as incremental levels keep coming then 2k is coming at some point. Can’t wait for the next 12 months to show us where we are heading
2023-10-06 18:00:29,Comment,2,"So I need moons & donuts 👍 and lots of them but Work coming 1st tends to tire me out except for occasional comments, but it’s good to see it flourish & others benefit for it"
2023-10-06 15:57:40,Comment,1,Awesome 👏 😂😂
2023-10-06 15:55:38,Comment,3,When persistent shilling by very few people takes place and the roadmap doesn’t seem to live up to the hype surrounding it

2023-10-05 17:18:27,Comment,1,Take everything of value off the guy including his socks 🧦
2023-10-05 16:45:12,Comment,1,"I’ve lost any trust of most people who spout off dribble and then change track each week depending on the trend of the day. 
I’d rather have respect to the captain of bollox as long as they went down with the ship at the bitter end, at least they believed their own nonsense"
2023-10-05 16:41:48,Comment,1,"I only hold a minimal amount in a CEX given the rise and fall of exchanges over the last 2 years, plus I like to know my ETH of what little I have is safe"
2023-10-05 14:16:41,Comment,1,Such a good vibe seeing this and can only increase as adoption takes hold
2023-10-02 17:45:43,Comment,1,Only time will tell and maybe 1 day ETH will be surpassed but not this bull run I feel
2023-10-02 08:37:41,Comment,1,Filling up on some donuts 🍩 ready for the bull
2023-10-01 18:12:43,Comment,1,He states he paid 56 ETH for it but that was money he was paid for selling scams to everyone. This sucker needs to sink deep & never resurface
2023-10-01 18:07:16,Comment,1,"The last bull run was an invaluable experience personally, and all the above you’ve stated is advise that should posted hourly until it becomes burnt into memory"
2023-10-01 18:04:19,Comment,1,Just hoping as many people see this as possible. Hate scammers with a passion
2023-09-30 14:57:50,Comment,1,So true to facts 😅 I’ve some change in ETH hanging about in a few wallets that I doubt I will ever see movement again
2023-09-30 14:54:16,Comment,1,I’m hoping your right in it being the biggest to date as I’ve put my very financial soul into the bear so fingers crossed 🤞 and if it works out I can make life for my family that little bit more comfortable. I’m looking forward to mass adoption and the tech that will advance with it
