2023-09-30 17:28:39,Comment,2,"A lot of ifs. Trying to be realistic. Because we are busy in our everyday lifes, we don't have so much knowledge and ibfornation to predict future. Yes, it is very possible that RCP's could be huge thing in future, but there is also such a possibility for other things. What I want to say, there is as great upside as downside."
