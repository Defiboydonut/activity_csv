2023-10-20 18:02:50,Comment,8,"u/dead-spiral is right, sadly, and so is his username. We are starting a spiral down with more downvotes. We had created a great community here where we upvote and are positive. We cannot let this slip away. I have noticed that there's been an increasing downvotes showing up for my comments too. It's the past weeks that this happens more frequently.

Can we for once stop that bullshit and act normal like any Reddit sub with up and downvotes?

Karma works like ""give what you want to receive"". So give what you want. Be positive.

Influx of more people in is great here. But not at the cost of destroying this sub too. I've been through that. It's not the way."

2023-10-01 08:18:38,Comment,2,That's why we're active on X too to tell people about donut.
2023-10-01 08:15:53,Comment,2,*you ain't seen nothing yet*
2023-10-01 08:13:42,Comment,2,Around 40k
2023-10-01 08:13:30,Comment,1,About 40k donuts I think
2023-10-01 08:06:30,Comment,1,I'm doing it with DONUT/ETH. About 150 donuts a day that I earn currently.
2023-10-01 07:48:33,Comment,2,Well said!
2023-10-01 07:46:42,Comment,2,We're getting there
2023-10-01 07:45:28,Comment,2,"Right. Quality of what you buy is of importance. That certainly applies to the things you really need to have. Yet, inflating your life style mostly isn't beneficial to your happiness."
2023-10-01 07:43:54,Comment,2,Absolutely. And I think it's true for everyone. Can't say that I don't fall for the trap of thinking it would make me more happy with more money. Yet also know it's definitely not a given.
2023-10-01 07:41:05,Comment,2,That makes you a sisnut? 😂
2023-10-01 07:38:11,Comment,2,People are waking up to the true use of crypto here. 👆
2023-10-01 07:37:18,Comment,2,"Sorry, sister. 👀"
2023-10-01 07:36:17,Comment,5,"The best way to be (more) financially free is to spend less. Always look for ways to spend less. A $2,000 car will drive the same road to the same destination as a $200,000 car would.

It is good to look for ways to accumulate more wealth. Crypto can do this. Just don't ever inflate your lifestyle.

Life is about family, friends, and good experiences. They can't be bought."
2023-10-01 07:33:56,Comment,2,We feel for you brother. Keep going.

2023-10-01 07:27:33,Comment,2,No way we are not going to stop until we are collectively wealthy and happy.
2023-10-01 07:20:58,Comment,7,I sincerely hope we can keep this community on Reddit positive and constructive. Let's weed out any negativity and manipulation. I like it here. Too many times subs change for the worse.

Good morning fellow donut travellers."

2023-10-01 07:13:21,Comment,4,"There's a lot of hopium on social media at the moment. Q4 is going to be a very good quarter, following all those optimistic views.

While I hope that we will be seeing some upside and a glimpse if early bull market, there's part of me concerned that it may be too early to call this upside time.

What do you think? Are we going to see some relief? Are we going to be moving upwards until the end of the year?

I'm positioned and waiting with my crypto bags."
2023-10-01 07:09:40,Comment,3,"Thanks , you too !"
2023-10-01 07:05:24,Comment,7,GM. Upvote the daily you all! Let's pump up those numbers.
2023-09-30 18:28:51,Comment,3,"We're an extraordinary bunch of people. We are few that were early on donuts. In a few years, people will call you all lucky.

Congratulations all. Being here has a big advantage over other people."
2023-09-30 18:20:21,Comment,4,No way that it affects crypto that much. Only if humans get emotional over it.
2023-09-30 18:17:41,Comment,4,Let's hope that q4 2023 serves us well in crypto 🍩
2023-09-30 18:16:56,Comment,4,100 sounds reasonable today
