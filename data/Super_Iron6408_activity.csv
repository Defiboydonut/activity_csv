2023-10-17 00:34:27,Comment,1,"Why do articles keep stating funds being staked are going to be sold.

They've been doing it with Ether, staking is not selling and it looks like some SOL that unlocked from FTX has been staked not sold"

I see alot of people talking about if I'd brought early, I'm like alot of people here, I'd have sold early, lost it in a hack or on an exchange that blew up.
