How are you going to find the odd one or two that pump before they do? Even if you do, how will you get out before the inevitable dump?

Imagine how many people think the same as you, put good money into *the next sure fire thing!* Only to see it go nowhere or drop lower!

P.S. you’ll be getting DMs about a ‘Pepe killer’ soon after posting this!
