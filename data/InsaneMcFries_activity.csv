2023-10-28 06:52:52,Comment,1,!myactivity
2023-10-28 06:52:45,Comment,1,Good bot
2023-10-27 18:59:12,Comment,1,When it dumps again we will have a lot more Bronuts following!
2023-10-27 18:58:37,Comment,1,Can’t wait to see how donuts respond considering we actually lost nothing in our fundamentals (except special membership)
2023-10-27 18:57:55,Comment,2,"The PB is over 5500 comments, i like your confidence though!"
2023-10-27 18:56:58,Comment,2,Can always trust you to have the ideal goals in mind
2023-10-27 18:47:53,Comment,2,Good idea on waiting for gas. It’s getting real low on weekends lately I think it even went down to <7
2023-10-27 18:47:11,Comment,1,Isn’t it usually the other way around?
2023-10-27 18:46:48,Comment,4,At least let us get 69
2023-10-27 18:46:28,Comment,1,It’s not allowed on reddit full stop
2023-10-27 18:45:29,Comment,4,2500 comments ain’t bad considering there’s like 6 hours left
2023-10-27 17:34:53,Comment,1,You all never cease to amaze me. We are really in it for the tech now!
2023-10-27 10:16:09,Comment,6,"This next bull run is going to show us where crypto is going, and also it may be the last huge one"
2023-10-27 08:20:44,Comment,2,"It just doesn’t seem to work out that way does, at least if you follow your emotions… best to take them out of the equation"
2023-10-27 08:20:07,Comment,3,"![img](avatar_exp|129308884|cry)

We can all relate to this situation right now!"
2023-10-27 06:00:00,Comment,3,A nice realistic goal. In the peak of the bull run I want $200m market cap and $1
2023-10-27 05:59:38,Comment,1,"Sure, I think it’s good to have all the avenues going at the moment though. To see what turns out to be the best or ideal of the bunch"
2023-10-27 05:58:51,Comment,3,We all need a good night’s rest and get our game on
2023-10-27 03:46:18,Comment,6,"My reddit notifications won’t work at all now, just email digest… first they take our CSV, then they take our notifications!"
2023-10-27 03:43:59,Comment,5,I believe if you haven’t had your first distribution there are issues with tipping
2023-10-27 03:37:57,Comment,3,to my heart
2023-10-27 03:36:54,Comment,3,I hope I have enough to have enough savings for any emergency and pay off my debts. Though the ratio has really dropped this month!
2023-10-27 03:35:39,Comment,3,You will still get donuts if you haven’t added the chain. As long as you have connected your MetaMask to the sub on PC they will arrive
2023-10-27 03:32:12,Comment,2,![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-27 03:31:56,Comment,2,DEPE for sure
2023-10-27 03:30:02,Comment,4,Uncertainty about the CSV. Watch everyone come flooding back when we get our distribution lmao
2023-10-27 03:19:32,Comment,1,True but since we also want to give the middle finger to reddit maybe there will be a joint effort with Kraken ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32642)
2023-10-27 03:18:50,Comment,3,Buy now and we can have another dip
2023-10-27 03:18:38,Comment,3,We’re always watching… waiting…
2023-10-27 01:33:32,Comment,3,"3% dip, something is seriously wrong in the markets!!!"
2023-10-27 01:32:45,Comment,3,And we celebrate with a decentralised 420 and 69
2023-10-27 01:29:17,Comment,4,"It’s not quite like that. The amount listed is the share of donuts we’d receive post ratio. I think that has to be halved again for the final count from what is there, unless it’s going to change with the manual snapshot"
2023-10-27 01:27:16,Comment,7,Really can’t believe what this community is capable of. Without each contribution we wouldn’t be able to say we can continue without a CSV. It just goes to show that donuts and this sub can transcend reddit and continue without a centralised figure that can pul the plug. What a time to be here!!
2023-10-27 01:18:02,Comment,2,Nope haven’t seen a poll since last snapshot
2023-10-27 01:15:58,Comment,2,It’s like when they gave the first free avatars and everyone’s sentiment flipped on NFTs. But it’s not gonna fly for the community points squad
2023-10-27 01:06:19,Comment,2,What’s the bet they’ll become reddit premium soon 😂
2023-10-26 21:12:52,Comment,2,It seems like this month it was 45 donuts per upvote on a post which is more than enough to offset it. In future it may became a larger problem
2023-10-26 21:01:20,Comment,2,Don’t think we can focus on a listing for a while yet due to reddit drama. I think it’ll happen one day as a massive surprise!
2023-10-26 20:54:34,Comment,1,Spoken like a bag holder
2023-10-26 20:54:04,Comment,1,Too busy with his orgies and stimulant medication
2023-10-26 20:53:09,Comment,3,Just shows how much we don’t need reddit. I’m so glad we control the contract
2023-10-26 20:52:17,Comment,3,End of crypto. How about the end of the entire internet as it is? That’s what we have to worry about
2023-10-26 20:51:40,Comment,2,Not even close. It’s a nice feature but they literally dropped a boulder on everyone’s hope of financial independence and bankrupted some
2023-10-26 20:50:52,Comment,2,"![img](avatar_exp|129308884|fire)

To that I have to say"
2023-10-26 20:48:22,Comment,2,We can learn from their IPO run up when we start our own business after the bull run!
2023-10-26 20:41:19,Comment,3,"![img](avatar_exp|129308884|take_my_energy)

Thanks, it was as easy as that!"
2023-10-26 20:34:06,Comment,2,"It’s amazing that this was whipped up in a single day. We can do this without reddit, it’s coming!"
2023-10-26 20:31:17,Comment,1,I can’t see them. Why does reddit do these staggered rollouts?
2023-10-26 09:58:20,Comment,3,"That’s incredible work dude really, amazing what you guys whip up so quickly for the good of the community. ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645) So I guess this could do as our CSV if we need it manually instead"
2023-10-26 09:26:39,Comment,4,The great good morning good night bronut famine has begun. When will it end???
2023-10-26 09:19:31,Comment,1,\[Automod\] Discussion
2023-10-26 09:18:55,Comment,1,"To generate this information I did the following:  
  
Manually went through a reddit search and collected the comment counts of the dailies.  
  
Used CoinGecko's export of Donut and ETH price data shown here: 

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum/historical\_data](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum/historical_data) 

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/historical\_data](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut/historical_data)  
  
Used Google Sheets to visualise the data."
2023-10-26 05:55:25,Comment,1,"Yes, it’s amazing how much the hype changed since the pumps"
2023-10-26 05:54:42,Comment,2,It’s been doing a damn good show of that already. Can’t wait for 2k again
2023-10-26 05:53:20,Comment,2,I’m worried about a potential replacement still. It could be worse
2023-10-26 05:29:18,Comment,2,This is the lowest I’ve seen since I’ve been here I think
2023-10-26 05:28:54,Comment,2,The green market is enough to keep us happy in these times!
2023-10-25 23:24:12,Comment,3,"What another day, we’ve been here the entire bear market"
2023-10-25 23:13:05,Comment,2,"You’re being honest, and it’s true. Fact is I had 5k karma in 9 years and then in the past year I gathered 40k… monetary incentives do have an effect"
2023-10-25 23:12:02,Comment,0,"Goodnight, it’s a shame the CSV isn’t here but I had my doubts :("
2023-10-25 08:45:42,Comment,1,Very keen to see how everyone’s hard work has paid off. Especially with all the drama. Good luck!
2023-10-25 08:44:44,Comment,2,"Possibly, I do wonder if we will get the CSV on time in the sub"
2023-10-25 08:43:55,Comment,2,Ahhh it’s a good time to be a bronut isn’t it? Put it all on the line for free ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-25 08:21:23,Comment,1,At least two so you are a reputable analyst
2023-10-25 08:19:23,Comment,3,I see a crystal ball but where are your tea leaves for confirmation?
2023-10-25 07:12:12,Comment,3,At least we get to find out the base amount of donuts we earned from karma!
2023-10-25 07:11:46,Comment,3,New month might be about starting now!
2023-10-25 05:34:58,Comment,3,"But yes lower ratio. And as we see price doesn’t necessarily correlate with activity, but perhaps volume does"
2023-10-25 05:34:21,Comment,3,Did you manage that recently? You and Hunt now haha!
2023-10-25 05:31:30,Comment,2,Still a week til distribution right though? Or can it go as soon as snapshot is released?
2023-10-25 05:30:43,Comment,2,Would love to see donuts follow this pump a bit! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-25 02:25:27,Comment,2,When… or if? ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640) you still holding though that’s respectable
2023-10-25 02:24:49,Comment,4,This is life changing stuff right here ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-25 02:07:01,Comment,2,These dailies are a great way to judge the fear and greed sentiment lmao
2023-10-25 01:58:06,Comment,1,When did you buy? Before 2021 and then DCA til now?
2023-10-25 01:56:32,Comment,2,It’s wild how a week ago we were wondering if we’d hit 1600 again ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-24 23:42:57,Comment,2,I hope we don’t all buy all the way up and all the way down again next cycle
2023-10-24 23:42:03,Comment,2,"Less than a day left, really hope reddit sends that damn CSV ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644)"
2023-10-24 23:41:35,Comment,5,Coinbase learn and earn (and through wallet!) are some of the best airdrops there are!
2023-10-24 09:45:35,Comment,3,"Who knows, if not today… plenty of people bought lower and they are probably ready to buy more if we dip back down we we can all see the potential with one piece of good news"
2023-10-24 09:44:07,Comment,3,As long as we get the damn CSV. Come on reddit do us this favour
2023-10-24 09:43:36,Comment,3,And $6900 ETH. Then on to 5 digits!
2023-10-24 09:41:20,Comment,4,Been a long time since I’ve seen BTC do a >10% pump and knock over multiple 1k targets… a welcome sight!
2023-10-24 08:57:17,Comment,1,"Yeah, it is reassuring to see the wider market succeed though. We are going to benefit from the increased volume soon enough"
2023-10-24 08:56:31,Comment,3,It’s all about some extra odds. I think there’s plenty of room for confirmation bias in TA but also it can be used to get better odds than going in blind perhaps
2023-10-24 06:53:14,Comment,6,Damn that’s a wild day we’ve had. Honestly this past week has been very conflicting and emotional. Here’s to more green days!
2023-10-24 06:12:42,Comment,2,"Damn I don’t see it yet, perhaps not for Australians"
2023-10-23 08:59:04,Comment,2,Old habits die hard 😓
2023-10-23 03:36:54,Comment,2,"True, maybe all that matters most is getting settle between jobs 😂"
2023-10-23 03:36:25,Comment,1,Lmao would settle for McDonald’s I guess
2023-10-23 03:33:28,Comment,2,This makes me think it’s a bull trap moreso
2023-10-23 03:25:13,Comment,2,But aren’t we glad it did ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-23 03:20:10,Comment,8,Bronuts im so screwed. Couldn’t hold down my job this week so I’m back to square one. I know you guys don’t know a bunch of my story but it’s so worrying that two weeks was my limit. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m proud I stuck it out for two weeks but I still want to disappear in a puff of smoke I’m so ashamed that I couldn’t make it to work
2023-10-22 22:48:33,Comment,2,"426, a lot for here but only 20 bucks worth"
2023-10-22 21:33:56,Comment,2,I’ll probably hold onto my airdrop bag and see what happens
2023-10-22 20:15:15,Comment,2,Plus we are some of the only coins they have left :)
2023-10-22 20:11:24,Comment,1,Maybe we could provide a link to it in the daily
2023-10-22 20:11:01,Comment,1,Feels bad to call them shitcoins but I scraped by for 8 months with moons and some bricks
2023-10-22 20:05:44,Comment,1,"I still see it, so that’s strange!"
2023-10-22 19:37:02,Comment,5,I’m surprised they are still looking for more people to ban. Welcome to the sub!
2023-10-22 19:36:23,Comment,2,If you consistently increase your ETH holdings that way I’m impressed
2023-10-22 19:35:32,Comment,1,We might need the help of a full blown crypto bull run
2023-10-22 19:34:01,Comment,1,The number you see changes just like with karma counts to avoid manipulation
2023-10-22 18:14:28,Comment,1,That’s the hazing ritual of joining crypto for the first time!
2023-10-22 17:59:36,Comment,2,"Oh so the game is real, sneaky bastards work really fast on these…"
2023-10-22 17:58:37,Comment,2,Calling them a taxi as we speak
2023-10-22 17:49:25,Comment,2,Which is really ridiculous because with some luck you can get top comment anyway. Guess they want to increase their chances whatever way they can..
2023-10-22 17:47:07,Comment,2,And that’s how the bull market launches
2023-10-22 17:46:39,Comment,2,I would do it all for my grandma honestly.
2023-10-22 17:41:28,Comment,1,"Absolutely, I’m thrilled. Hope it’s a great harvest for everyone and I’m excited to present the graphs about daily activity this month!"
2023-10-22 17:39:34,Comment,2,Good eye mate. Actually a few of us didn’t really question it I think
2023-10-22 17:36:44,Comment,1,Might even be a good time to trade BTC for ETH right?
2023-10-22 17:35:47,Comment,1,That’s definitely touching some grass
2023-10-22 17:35:22,Comment,3,This better not awaken anything in me
2023-10-22 17:34:36,Comment,2,I think our daily is just so active there are many upvotes here. Perhaps there are more downvoters than we realise in the sub
2023-10-22 17:33:27,Comment,2,Don’t think we can confirm that until we get rock solid ETF news. The pumps were pretty great since XRP lawsuit was dropped!
2023-10-22 14:24:58,Comment,3,We will find out then if it’s disbelief or a bull trap
2023-10-22 14:22:47,Comment,3,"Link is in a $5-10$ trading range for like 18 months now, I really hope for all accumulators that it breaks out of this range to the upside!"
2023-10-22 14:21:14,Comment,1,Fiat and donut mining at least ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-22 14:19:37,Comment,1,The step to opt for a server-based progression is a good one and it makes onboarding for crypto features a process that under user control which might encourage them that way.
2023-10-22 14:03:23,Comment,4,"I don’t know if they would do cross chain swaps to donuts on launch, but maybe with time that is a goal. I assume they want to do the same with polygon"
2023-10-22 14:00:55,Comment,2,Thanks for the tip after all!! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)
2023-10-22 14:00:13,Comment,3,I respect your continued enthusiasm nonetheless. That’s a heavy loss and you’re taking it in stride
2023-10-22 13:58:59,Comment,3,Welcome to your more laidback and pleasant home ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)

2023-10-22 13:36:41,Comment,1,"I’m so happy donuts maintained their separation from reddit, like some other community tokens. We were blinded as to what could happen when they were not."
2023-10-22 13:35:39,Comment,2,"It’s a great FUD scenario, anyone who loaded the bags at these prices will win I reckon."

2023-10-22 08:57:01,Comment,3,All your exams are done already? Nice job man only 2 hours! 😉
2023-10-22 08:55:33,Comment,3,"His account is gone, I guess any “alt” is extremely difficult to prove now that the account is deleted"
2023-10-22 08:54:38,Comment,5,"Got them listed on major exchanges, soon after both moons and bricks had penalties if you weren’t a holder, then pull the plug out of the blue. Quite depressing how reddit played this one"
2023-10-22 08:53:30,Comment,3,Sounds like you need a jelly donut stat!
2023-10-22 08:43:40,Comment,3,It gets more accurate as we get closer to snapshot but since it is limited per user to their last 1000 reddit contributions that sways the donut estimate a lot I think
2023-10-22 08:39:11,Comment,4,We might still see >1 this month but not for much longer!!
2023-10-22 08:38:36,Comment,3,Bitcoin SV without a doubt. It’s in the top 100 like why?
2023-10-22 08:16:29,Comment,3,"That’s my secret… I’m always ready

2023-10-22 07:45:31,Comment,3,Hope we get the CSV as per usual or things are gonna get shaken up!
2023-10-22 06:10:39,Comment,2,"Sell them today, for the greater good!"
2023-10-22 06:06:30,Comment,2,I think it’s the same second mod post
2023-10-22 05:55:54,Comment,2,Hope to see ETH above 1700 if BTC maintains this support! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-22 05:54:07,Comment,2,"I really hope reddit sends through that CSV, Thursday morning will be an anxious awakening

EDIT: do you guys think if they don’t send the CSV donuts might get an even larger dump? It’s kinda worrying to me."
2023-10-22 05:48:35,Comment,3,Wrong direction on the graph! Although true for donuts lol ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)

2023-10-22 05:39:11,Comment,2,Hope can carry us a long way but we should expect the reality to be quite similar as we grow 😓
2023-10-22 05:37:52,Comment,1,This is how our communities should be. Decentralised and working together ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)
2023-10-22 05:37:13,Comment,1,Hope to see a big breakout on this one. BTC better hold that 30k for us!
2023-10-22 05:33:04,Comment,1,Curious to see the price action on this one after the week we’ve had! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-22 05:28:25,Comment,1,"Wow that is impressive development, we’ve been looking for this for quite a while now. Nice job to Rick!"
2023-10-22 05:27:20,Comment,2,Oh thanks for the update! I thought someone provided a link where it could be traded. Looking forward to the launch and hope it all goes well ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)
2023-10-22 05:25:39,Comment,2,"LINK has been in a *very long* trading range between 6 and 10, it’s time for them to get some action. If it goes well above $10 that’s a great sign for the future"
2023-10-22 05:23:56,Comment,2,"Yes, I spent the majority of the last 9 months there, and a bit in 2021. Very different place to here. Basically every comment you expected downvotes and it sort of gave an anxious feeling to contributing. In here you can just speak your mind without much worry at all"
2023-10-22 05:22:16,Comment,4,"Oh my gosh that’s awesome, what a great job! I assume the same thing won’t be possible on Reddit’s mobile app, unless we could add it to our user flair?

What is the scales thing about, is it our governance score?"
2023-10-22 05:19:49,Comment,3,I think there were a lot of downvote bots there and that lead to a larger butterfly effect of a toxic community that was hesitant to upvote due to the emotions that brings. We just haven’t gotten large enough to see that sort of action yet
2023-10-22 05:16:49,Comment,1,Good luck with your exams. Gotta have the fiat mines ready to go with this our side hustle in the sub! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-22 04:55:59,Comment,1,"Sure, but the issue is the moons attached to their doxxed wallet that was eligible for moderator distributions and karma earnings"
2023-10-22 04:46:31,Comment,2,I can get him an appointment with our cannabis doctors lmao
2023-10-22 04:45:49,Comment,1,And the one in flairs that I love rocking! Wish the flair emojis were also in the stack
2023-10-22 04:45:02,Comment,3,"Anyone still having trouble tipping posts? When I visit the donut finance link it doesn’t update to the post, just stays on the default tipping screen"
2023-10-22 04:42:19,Comment,9,I didn’t have any qualms connecting my arb nova address because I don’t need to use it anymore… 😂
2023-10-22 04:28:29,Comment,2,The Karen lmao is this a new word for kraken cos I saw you posted it twice 😂
2023-10-22 04:27:18,Comment,2,"I agree, there’s no better way right now to change sentiment on donuts than bullish recovery"
2023-10-22 04:26:22,Comment,3,I think the insider FUD might have got people scared a bit.
2023-10-22 04:20:37,Comment,4,It might be a bit harder for now to get a listing since the reddit drama. Give it a few months to cool off and hopefully the markets turn and we can push harder again
2023-10-22 04:16:56,Comment,2,Actually now that you mention it that is quite funny. Just days ago people were comparing moonsdust to moons and moons ATH market cap
2023-10-22 04:11:00,Comment,3,"I think they do, they’ve been on BSC since 2021 and someone posted a swap link earlier"
2023-10-22 04:09:00,Comment,4,They are 3c already I wonder if they show a dump or pump soon?
2023-10-22 04:07:29,Comment,3,Don’t blame you for panicking out but you had some nice patience to buy back in at this price. Welcome back ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32636)
2023-10-22 04:00:03,Comment,3,I think the announcement was pulled earlier today. Website is working on my end!
2023-10-22 03:55:31,Comment,1,A strong community and a strong base of haters means it is wildly volatile
2023-10-22 03:42:26,Comment,2,It’s a week after but then the multisig transaction contract has to be released and then signed by all the mods
2023-10-22 03:41:59,Comment,3,I’m surprised we got any distributions at all then!
2023-10-22 03:41:04,Comment,2,Just about need whistleblower protection for that centralised community lmao
2023-10-22 03:40:16,Comment,2,Well it would be silly for them to do that before getting as much volume in fees as they can! I’m positive reddit screwed them over just like they did to us
2023-10-22 03:39:31,Comment,1,"The association we have with Reddit’s failure is troubling, but I hope we can maintain the very realistic separation between donuts and reddit in the market sentiment."
2023-10-22 03:26:48,Comment,4,"What it accomplishes is diminishing prosocial activity even further, so less people will upvote or even contribute, creating a more toxic community IMO. Honestly it probably has quite the butterfly effect past the downvotes they do to the wider community as whole. Would be interesting to see the statistics on how that unfolded"
2023-10-22 03:24:08,Comment,2,I hope we see another donut avatar in spooky season! Though I am hesitant to give reddit more money now
2023-10-22 03:23:23,Comment,5,I have more faith in the remaining decentralised community points than I did with the official ones. Plus $200m market cap feels like a reasonable goal of the higher end of a bull run. Our ATH was only $8m in 2021
2023-10-22 03:13:10,Comment,2,More time here to accumulate before we reach the point of no return? Sounds good to me!
2023-10-22 03:12:15,Comment,4,I’m glad you got more work coming in again man! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644)
2023-10-22 03:11:53,Comment,3,Gone are the days of anxiety that any comment regardless of quality could be downvoted… it was such a stupid place like that
2023-10-22 02:55:19,Comment,2,"Yeah using the username seems like an incredibly reckless move for anyone meant to be taking the vote manipulation seriously. Gathering people for a ring like that must be really dangerous, I’d imagine you’d want to cover your tracks better than using your username…

I know that they’d obviously need the username to be able to keep the ring going but still"
2023-10-22 02:52:00,Comment,6,"Donut market cap is currently a mere $1.2m. I think a $200m market cap is achievable in the next bull run, putting donuts at $1. From here, that’s well over 100x. We are going to need a lot of patience over the next couple of years but it’s doable!"
2023-10-22 02:48:19,Comment,3,"I think even here there was 10k comments, which is wild when you compare to late July this year before the pumps where it was sometimes as low as 12"
2023-10-22 02:47:17,Comment,5,"I wonder what each of us would have done in the same situation? Could we really say we wouldn’t have done the same thing?

I’d also like to know if that discord screenshot was legitimate. A vote manipulation ring is never okay, but that could’ve been easily faked"
2023-10-22 02:43:50,Comment,2,"I wonder what will happen to L2s in that case or the deflationary structure of ETH. I mean it is slightly inflationary or has been with fees of 50c, what will happen then? Will transactions volume increase too and make it deflationary even when individual transactions are so cheap?"
2023-10-22 02:25:25,Comment,3,"It shows how much of it was related to the token itself, I mean it’s probably true here as well. However I bet a lot of people are absolutely crushed and just disappeared which I completely understand"
2023-10-22 02:24:23,Comment,1,"I’m down for this ride, again we just need to stay focused on what we are truly waiting for… the next bull run. Not all of this drama and the centralised destruction of community points."
2023-10-22 02:22:55,Comment,2,Give the exchange the initial bag worth like $250k is the easiest. I bet a shitload of memecoins are listed that way
2023-10-21 23:30:41,Comment,4,Donuts really took a hit today… is buying the answer or is it best to watch this drama go by first?
2023-10-21 23:16:53,Comment,2,This is the creator of CCMoons…
2023-10-21 23:16:14,Comment,3,"Whatever offsets the insane living costs we have to deal with in the modern age, nice one!"
2023-10-21 23:15:09,Comment,2,I think because they haven’t officially launched yet? I have no idea either how to trade them yet
2023-10-21 23:14:28,Comment,3,Insane that reddit wouldn’t even allow a final distribution to go through…
2023-10-21 21:27:29,Comment,2,Lmao if you guys dm your address I would definitely make that happen
2023-10-21 11:40:35,Comment,2,I honestly don’t blame them. Would I have done the same in that position? Quite possibly…
2023-10-21 11:38:09,Comment,3,423 moon dust ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) picked a good distribution month to do it though!
2023-10-21 11:34:45,Comment,1,"Number 1 for sure, moons will never die!!"
2023-10-21 11:33:55,Comment,2,"You can use a mobile browser on reddit, load the desktop page and click the donut symbol next to their username on the comment. Then copy the donut finance link into MetaMask and you’re good to go"
2023-10-21 11:32:04,Comment,3,Wow he deleted his account? That’s insane… it was only yesterday we saw him commenting
2023-10-21 11:31:20,Comment,2,A trusted individual has my seed phrase. I don’t have much but I’d want my family to be able to access what I have
2023-10-21 11:10:13,Comment,3,Will it be snapshot or snapsnot?
2023-10-21 11:09:25,Comment,3,Modumplings sound delicious however
2023-10-21 11:08:53,Comment,2,Damn I love apple pie. That might be my favourite yet
2023-10-21 11:08:08,Comment,2,"Damn, binance card is one of those I always wanted in Australia. That cash back is hard if not impossible to find"

2023-10-21 09:53:27,Comment,3,I feel like you’ll need reddit premium for gifs going forward…
2023-10-21 09:52:16,Comment,4,[mydonuts.online](https://mydonuts.online) will do the trick!

2023-10-21 07:17:45,Comment,1,If you earned donuts last distribution go to https://moonsdust.com/donut/
2023-10-21 06:11:28,Comment,4,It’s pretty surreal but we can thank the XRP news for that
2023-10-21 06:08:51,Comment,3,Weekend fiat mining enjoy brother!
2023-10-21 05:31:04,Comment,1,Thanks for clarifying that!
2023-10-21 05:30:44,Comment,3,At least $1 or $200m market cap surely is reasonable!
2023-10-21 05:27:49,Comment,3,I would say the same. A few months of accumulation should do the trick!
2023-10-21 05:27:03,Comment,2,This is the perfect event for us to do just that ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)

2023-10-21 04:14:38,Comment,2,"You do, I mean it’s only to arb nova now and idgaf about that but I’d understand if you didn’t want to. If you call the contract directly there is a link in the pinned post"
2023-10-21 04:11:05,Comment,3,"The tipping culture in coneheads, StellarCannaCoin and here is so strong. Idk if it’s just because moons didn’t have a bot to let people know but it feels amazing"
2023-10-21 04:10:18,Comment,3,I want to buy more ETH!!! Damn donuts nearly at 1c again makes me so happy
2023-10-21 03:37:55,Comment,2,"Would be silly for them to delist moons and bricks before the volume settles, reddit did fuck them over just as they did us though"
2023-10-21 03:36:32,Comment,2,Any moon revival will just be a pump and dump for whoever remains IMO
2023-10-21 03:35:52,Comment,6,Safemoon is doing better than moons 😓
2023-10-21 03:35:36,Comment,6,We smashed past 69 yesterday it was a spectacle

2023-10-21 01:57:24,Comment,5,"I don’t think that’s true, at least if you earned a fair bit. I got 16 dollars worth. However I can’t find a place to swap them for now either, perhaps because they haven’t officially launched just yet?"
2023-10-21 01:56:39,Comment,2,Video games ruin my routine but damn if they aren’t a good way to take your mind off things
2023-10-21 01:55:55,Comment,1,It sure does! Let’s make the most of our spare time away from fiat mining by donut mining ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-21 01:16:43,Comment,2,No and no selling penalties either
2023-10-21 01:16:09,Comment,2,Donuts looking better from here IMO. I think moons if they do pump would be a pump and dump for existing holders
2023-10-21 00:59:39,Comment,1,"It could be a malicious contract. I just saw your post below, perhaps it was a phishing link for orbiter and not the real website?"

2023-10-21 00:57:21,Comment,1,Did you connect your wallet anywhere? Is the token not added to your MetaMask or is it added but empty balance?
2023-10-21 00:56:27,Comment,2,I think a combination of XRP suit dropped plus more ETF approval hype

2023-10-20 23:39:28,Comment,2,"I don’t blame you, it is a slap in the face by reality. The truth is that you’re right and anything we believe is a safe bet could come crashing down just the same. Maybe you will change your investing habits after this?"
2023-10-20 23:31:35,Comment,2,It sounds absolutely devastating to have another investment blow up. I only hope that since we are still in a bearish market it is a prime time to accumulate and the bull run will make all of this feel like a fever dream. You have a strong goal with your girlfriend and that can carry one a very long way!
2023-10-20 23:28:16,Comment,2,Matic 1000x and ARB 600x? Idk bro but it would be amazing to see that. Donuts I expect $1 or $200m market cap!
2023-10-20 23:19:50,Comment,2,"No, it gives you the link to add the token after your claim"
2023-10-20 23:17:40,Comment,3,"Moons were a beacon of hope for many of us, part of our vision of an easier future financially… it’s very sad to witness their demise. Hope you’re doing okay and you’re very welcome in here. Donuts are a great substitute!"

2023-10-20 10:53:15,Comment,2,"I feel like not only the mods would sell but so would many users given the opportunity. I know the insider info is one thing and I know the remaining mods have giant stacks and act as whales, however I feel remaining users wouldn’t behave much differently"

2023-10-20 10:44:52,Comment,2,Donuts will flip moons soon and it’s depressing how that worked out but it’s for the best ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)

2023-10-20 10:35:33,Comment,4,A relief to see the overall market on the up after the shitshow of last week. We are still gonna make it everyone ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)

2023-10-20 10:20:03,Comment,2,Uptober is back on the menu I guess! 30k BTC and ETH back above 1600 is a good sight after last week
2023-10-20 10:17:00,Comment,8,No idea why people think it’s acceptable to throw such hate at another human being. At the end of the day you were successful at gaining karma and there was probably a lot of jealousy and disbelief on that part. Cashing out with 5k is pretty nice and I hope you can put it to good use for the upcoming bull market. Nice to have you back ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)

2023-10-20 10:09:27,Comment,1,Strong hate and also a strong community… the ticket to lots of volume and volatility IMO. The hate only fuels it more

2023-10-20 07:34:48,Comment,2,"I gained my 9-5 literally a week before community points got slammed. I used to make my living with moons. I’m sad others in my position won’t be able to do the same anymore, though donuts are a great substitute"
2023-10-20 07:33:30,Comment,3,Still feels surreal. Waking up to a message and it being that was actually nuts… 1h after we got it I woke up to $0.02 moons and $0.004 donuts
2023-10-20 07:32:39,Comment,5,What is the backup plan if that’s the case?
2023-10-20 07:21:09,Comment,2,Gary said *when* approved and it makes me so excited!

2023-10-20 05:35:30,Comment,4,Bet more community points earners are going outside this weekend than usual after the week we’ve had
2023-10-20 05:33:42,Comment,2,Less than a week til snapshot already. Time goes so fast especially when the distribution is later than a week after snapshot
2023-10-20 05:32:50,Comment,1,Gensler said “*when* it’s approved” which sounds definitive
2023-10-20 02:38:58,Comment,3,"We were blinded and thought nothing could go wrong, but people had definitely mentioned in the past that it could get rugged one day. Wish we listened, it’s easy to get caught up in the echo chambers"

2023-10-19 22:44:02,Comment,2,If you’re ready to call something dead it’s probably going to make a comeback of some sort next bull. We all have seen what calling a project dead usually leads to… the bottom

2023-10-19 01:57:09,Comment,3,Wow didn’t expect to see them so close but that announcement obviously changed everything
2023-10-19 01:55:37,Comment,1,CMC doesn’t have the correct information for market cap and it’s history either I don’t think.
2023-10-19 01:54:07,Comment,2,Influx of cc members to EthTrader and the fact that donuts aren’t even really hit by that announcement. It was panic based drop
2023-10-19 00:21:01,Comment,2,Things have certainly changed since then and everyone knows it
2023-10-19 00:18:39,Comment,2,It tickled 1c again yesterday

2023-10-18 19:31:18,Comment,2,"A black swan event without a change in what makes donuts so great, and adding more new members… I think it’s a healthy redistribution of the community of reddit tokens. We can continue in our decentralised venture with a reminder of why that is so important"
2023-10-18 19:25:33,Comment,1,You can see the previous post on my profile for last month. I’ll be doing it monthly on snapshot day! Glad there’s interest in the topic

2023-10-18 19:15:59,Comment,2,"Haha I’ve been there, dealt with that for a good six months! Difference is in here the daily feels much more friendly, I avoided it entirely in cc as it felt so difficult to gain traction and a waste of the 50 comment limit. Without the limit here, and plentiful upvotes in this one, the daily is the main hangout and it feels so much smoother"
2023-10-18 19:13:38,Comment,2,"Goodnight mate, have a well-deserved rest after the day it has been! We will take the reigns to push on the comments for today ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32643)"

2023-10-18 19:06:00,Comment,2,It’s a black swan event for donuts and I think it is healthy for a bullish outlook considering the fundamentals haven’t really changed at all
2023-10-18 19:04:26,Comment,3,I’m compiling the data for the monthly price vs daily comment count post and it’s going to be very interesting for the rest of snapshot ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)

2023-10-18 19:00:45,Comment,1,I’m still targeting $200m market cap or around $1 as very possible in a bull run. This FUD may actually help us achieve it in the long run as donuts may become the largest token of the sort
2023-10-18 18:59:50,Comment,1,Cuddling is allowed. Huddling even
2023-10-18 18:56:08,Comment,1,"We got a smart one here! I think you’ll be successful in whatever you decide to do, that degree is special!

Indeed, it’s very sad. That was the hope that moons gave its users. I’m glad donuts can still provide that"
2023-10-18 18:52:19,Comment,2,"Every *post* (a new thread) costs the user 250 donuts from their next distribution. Depending on the ratio next distribution, you may need anywhere from 25-50 or more upvotes to offset that cost. Tipping the posts can help the creator make back some extra donuts too.

Tipping and receiving tips has its own segment of the distribution, so you’ll often gain back some extra rewards by tipping or receiving tips too"
2023-10-18 18:46:46,Comment,2,"We passed 69 and for that, we deserve recognition ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)"

2023-10-18 18:39:40,Comment,2,Did you have them in before yesterday’s drama? I imagine you made quite the APR with all that transaction volume!
2023-10-18 18:38:08,Comment,2,It’s a shakeup and redistributes the ratios between the remaining RCPs which maintain a separation from reddit. It’s good for the space now that we know what reddit was capable of dropping on its loyal users for the sake of their IPO
2023-10-18 18:32:44,Comment,2,We are on pace for over 6k comments. 1600 per 6 hours so another 1600 to go or thereabouts!
2023-10-18 18:31:12,Comment,3,"It’s such a relief to see donuts clawing back out on the other side. We are gonna make it, cannot wait for the next bull run!"
2023-10-18 18:29:34,Comment,1,There was a lot of pettiness and maybe bots responsible for that greed. It made posting often times anxiety-inducing as you’d expect to be downvoted like 50% of the time. This place has been a night and day difference on that front
2023-10-18 18:26:11,Comment,2,"Snapshot period is the same as over at cc, so about one week from now it will take place"
2023-10-18 18:23:41,Comment,3,"The estimate goes down over the month, approaching snapshot where it will be most accurate. The problem is that reddit API is limited to 1000 contributions per user, so every user that has over 1000 provides an inaccurate donut estimate to the calculator."
2023-10-18 18:21:27,Comment,4,"My favourites are ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640) and ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639), RIP our beloved snek"

2023-10-18 18:18:51,Comment,1,"Yes, very happy about that! What are you studying, have I asked that before? I hope it’s going well there man! Keep it up!

I didn’t get burned by moons as I was a 0.1 KM maxi after the pumps; I couldn’t afford to buy back my stack to keep earning. Part of the reason I switched to here. I’m grateful for that, but it’s devastating for everyone affected and I hurt for y’all"
2023-10-18 18:14:35,Comment,3,"It wouldn’t take much for that to change, I’ll prepare
For the worst on that one. Though, with all the cc drama I imagine people would be less likely to than before, at least for a few months"
2023-10-18 18:12:48,Comment,2,"A 100% pump back to 1c (briefly), it really has been a volatile day. Liquidity providers would be having a nice harvest"
2023-10-18 18:12:01,Comment,2,"After all the disappointment it is really great to know people have a place to go. I was entirely a cc user up until last month, but preferred being here much more so made the switch. I am happy others can now do the same ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)"
2023-10-18 18:09:15,Comment,2,"Cone is also decentralised from reddit, on polygon chain. Not in the vault!"
2023-10-18 18:06:22,Comment,2,"Been working brother, finally got a job (seems like good timing, one of those moments where it feels like life is turning out like it meant to, RCP and particularly moons used to be my only income). I’m doing well just got less time during the week as I have to focus on work and family obligations. Will see more of me on the weekend though!

Thanks for your concern ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645) how are you doing yourself mate?"
2023-10-18 18:04:16,Comment,2,"Neither, feels good to have held through that. We will make it Bronuts! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)"
2023-10-18 18:03:10,Comment,2,StellarCannaCoin and Cone are great as well. There’s a few coins that were segregated from reddit which is a relief. This is my home though ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-18 18:01:21,Comment,2,There’s been periods of this before recently anyway. Let’s see what happens going forward

2023-10-18 09:26:52,Comment,2,"I didn’t quit for it, but it got me through the last 8 months and for that I’m thankful. Very sad that that option is no longer there in the same form as the opportunity I had. 😓"
2023-10-18 09:25:39,Comment,1,Like a phoenix from the ashes we hope!
2023-10-18 09:24:58,Comment,3,I’m so glad we stayed this decentralised direction. I bet reddit would’ve accepted us if we jumped on board with moons and bricks to our own ends…
2023-10-18 08:29:41,Comment,2,"I feel like they are just appeasing shareholders for their IPO. Plus gotta monopolise their own gold system, can't have competitors on their platform ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)"
2023-10-18 08:27:50,Comment,5,The panic is always larger than it should be. Same thing in the opposite direction for the fake news on ETF approval.
2023-10-18 08:09:51,Comment,4,This would be an interesting legal setup for reddit.
2023-10-18 07:11:58,Comment,3,And a slap in the face
2023-10-18 05:46:33,Comment,2,I know right… they are equivalent in the harm caused!
2023-10-18 02:18:38,Comment,1,"It’s bought with donuts here. In other subs it was with money or the token, but money was always cheaper."
2023-10-18 02:12:14,Comment,3,"Unless we pool together a hundreds of thousands of dollars to offer the exchange a stack, it seems unlikely for now"
2023-10-18 02:11:42,Comment,2,DCA in from here may be a better idea than ever. Or it might not! We don’t shit about fuck as always. If you plan on stacking donuts I’d say DCA in
2023-10-18 02:10:25,Comment,3,Well it hopefully is better for RCP investors…
2023-10-18 02:09:50,Comment,2,"All they care about is that he is the one who cops all the blame, and keeping the shareholders happy for the IPO"
2023-10-18 02:09:17,Comment,2,Wait seriously? Do you mean when mods got their distribution the moderator segment of that distribution was unaffected? Or all of it. That’s messed up
2023-10-18 02:08:31,Comment,2,"Yes the special membership will go which is sad, I doubt we will even get reimbursed either. The rest is fairly decentralised!"
2023-10-18 02:07:40,Comment,3,I don’t blame them. It would be brutal and the future feels very uncertain. For those who remain it’s as good of a time to accumulate by buying with lower prices and perhaps earning with lower activity too
2023-10-18 02:06:26,Comment,3,Yeah moons seem like they’ve been ground to dust now. Very unfortunate
2023-10-18 02:05:57,Comment,3,"Panic spreads quickly. I’m sure a lot of whales wanted to get out of it all for now. I hope we recover soon!

I think CONE also suffered a hit"
2023-10-17 23:57:25,Comment,2,It’s still bullshit because it was only months ago that they made an official ruling on community points. Now it’s in the shitter worse than we could’ve expected. All for their IPO of course. I bet it’s the shareholders that were at risk
2023-10-17 23:56:00,Comment,2,I’m glad you made a trade on your moons at least. That’s nothing to scoff at. Two jobs though ugh what are these living costs we have?
2023-10-17 23:55:20,Comment,1,"A 25% bounce, people are buying. I don’t know what today will bring though"
2023-10-17 23:54:45,Comment,1,You might be able to by loading desktop page on your mobile for reddit on your browser… not certain of that. It’s going to be difficult
2023-10-17 23:53:29,Comment,1,That number one whale who sold probably quite relieved. Ahh what a morning to have…
2023-10-17 22:38:32,Comment,3,I feel blessed that I accidentally DCAd out as RCP was my only income for a while. I hurt for everyone who had savings in the tokens 😫
2023-10-17 22:37:37,Comment,1,I’ve never been happier for donuts to be decentralised and distanced from community points!
2023-10-17 21:53:07,Comment,2,"Possibly, but would that trading volume have been a net positive? Maybe not if they were left holding the bags"
2023-10-17 21:52:07,Comment,1,"I doubt it, probably it will be locked behind reddit premium. Reddit needs their cut…"

2023-10-17 21:37:01,Comment,1,"For a lot of us these communities felt like a way out, a beacon of hope. It is really sad to see reddit shatter those dreams for their upcoming IPO."
2023-10-17 21:35:43,Comment,4,Almost couldn’t give a crap about downvotes at this point ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-17 20:12:16,Comment,1,They really did. It’s very disappointing to see this day arrive especially after they touted points just months ago
2023-10-17 20:10:54,Comment,1,Yep being on the outskirts seemed to the best thing for us. Another boon to decentralisation!
2023-10-17 20:02:41,Comment,1,Yeah I do like the separation between donuts and reddit at this point. Will be sad to see the special memberships go too
2023-10-17 19:48:48,Comment,5,Oh god that was not a good message to wake up to… what the hell reddit
2023-10-17 11:10:01,Comment,2,I’ve seen his crystal ball. It’s confirmed
2023-10-17 11:09:00,Comment,2,Surely we see $20k-$40k by then
2023-10-17 11:04:28,Comment,1,Interesting… thanks for the clarification. I guess then it’s about their salty alt game 😂
2023-10-17 11:00:21,Comment,2,"I don’t know if that stops them from seeing and downvoting your comments. For me they would show up as blocked user and the comment was able to be revealed, so then they know you have blocked them because they probably see you the same way… it’s a risky game to play in these subs unfortunately"
2023-10-17 10:56:56,Comment,1,"If anything it’s best to be stacking now before the news. Though to be fair, it *is* still possible the ETFs are just rejected and we see massive red candles"
2023-10-17 10:53:39,Comment,2,The tokenomics of PEPE 3.0 are far superior. There’s no question in my mind. I’ll admit HarryPotterSonicInu has a great development team behind them
2023-10-17 10:49:37,Comment,2,When you bring finances into a social media community there are definite frustrating negatives that the greed brings
2023-10-17 10:48:22,Comment,2,PEPE 3.0
2023-10-17 10:38:01,Comment,3,They think they’re working smarter by bringing the overall karma earned down… it’s just petty in the end. They’d be better just contributing quality and enjoying their time here
2023-10-17 10:34:09,Comment,1,That’s enough to swing our sentiment and begin calling it uptober until tomorrow!
2023-10-17 10:33:03,Comment,1,And glad they said cya to Charles
2023-10-17 10:31:18,Comment,2,"We have many regrets this bear market. If you invested in FTM in June 2021 it would’ve made over 10x. It’s all about luck in the end, a gamble"
2023-10-17 10:29:17,Comment,1,It’s not your money anymore when it’s in the bank. It’s their loan ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-17 10:28:25,Comment,1,"And to risk being cliche, donuts? ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)"
2023-10-17 10:27:55,Comment,1,Does it really? Now that’s an interesting flippening to say the least
2023-10-17 10:27:20,Comment,1,And hence why we ride all the way to the top and then all the way back down. Feels weird to try to turn the tap off when it seems like nothing will ever fail again
2023-10-17 10:25:57,Comment,2,And some 69s and 420s from somebody…
2023-10-17 10:25:30,Comment,1,"True, proper self custody in your own wallet, especially a side wallet not being used as a hot wallet and connecting to potentially dangerous applications, is as safe as you can get"
2023-10-17 10:15:04,Comment,2,Not staring at prices and charts all day = less emotional mayhem for me
2023-10-17 10:09:47,Comment,2,How do you make 0.69 of a co
2023-10-17 10:09:24,Comment,3,I find the same concern about the charts funnily enough. CCMoons is motivating for the most part I reckon!
2023-10-17 10:08:49,Comment,2,I’d probably just hide in our donut haven here even if the worst happened. It would bloody suck though
2023-10-17 10:08:05,Comment,3,A study showed that the first thing people used to do upon waking was go to the bathroom. It is now use your phone!

2023-10-17 09:21:29,Comment,1,Ahh a degen is among us
2023-10-17 09:21:15,Comment,1,ETH is just a safer bet though I think there is crazy upside potential for donuts still ofc
2023-10-17 09:20:37,Comment,2,What if we don’t trust trust? Sounds like a safemoon
2023-10-17 09:19:46,Comment,2,And governments still have control. Imagine with a CBDC
2023-10-17 08:41:32,Comment,1,"None of us do, but the upside potential is huge. These little movements will mean nothing by next year or the year after!"
2023-10-17 08:29:45,Comment,1,I’ll earn them for now but might throw some in for them soon ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)

2023-10-17 02:39:08,Comment,3,I gotchu enjoy!
2023-10-17 02:33:42,Comment,3,Necessary evil… until we gain financial independence in a few years ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-17 02:32:39,Comment,4,Good time to buy as any before a listing!
2023-10-17 02:29:10,Comment,3,Oooh I want to know as well! Gosh I feel so in the dark with all this work haha
2023-10-17 02:28:33,Comment,3,I expect $1 or $200m market cap in the next bull!
2023-10-17 02:27:50,Comment,2,Very early. ATH market cap was $8 bloody mil in a blow off top in 2021. That’s tiny!
2023-10-17 00:33:42,Comment,1,Sushi though reliable is a strong word after their exploit I guess
2023-10-17 00:33:01,Comment,2,"You too, take care! Back to work in a few minutes ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644) gotta earn for DCA."
2023-10-17 00:30:12,Comment,3,Doesn’t look the SEC would play ball on that though I am half expecting a 4D chess approval soon 😂
2023-10-17 00:29:11,Comment,2,"Congrats on your first month, it’s great to have more people in the sub!"
2023-10-17 00:28:29,Comment,2,"Just in time on break for the new daily! Hope your week has started well everybody. Some red for donuts, some green for the markets ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) keep earning!"
2023-10-16 21:56:34,Comment,2,The fees are already pretty high on uniswap I’ve found… I tend towards other swap sites
2023-10-16 21:56:04,Comment,2,"When I opened the BTC chart to see it tickle 30k I was like what news have I missed? Fake news, oh well"
2023-10-16 21:48:18,Comment,3,I feel this in my soul. I mined 0.01 BTC in 2013 and left ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) oh well it’s donut era now
2023-10-16 21:47:13,Comment,1,"All depending on a listing while we have earnings over 1.0, and if a listing happens, some extra disposable income"
2023-10-16 21:37:23,Comment,3,At least reddit cake days are still functional!
2023-10-16 21:36:40,Comment,1,We know that next time BTC will probably flip 30k to a support ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)
2023-10-16 21:35:27,Comment,1,That would be right if Gary actually gave any information about what the SEC is doing other than ums and ahs
2023-10-16 20:16:48,Comment,1,So how was your 7th birthday?
2023-10-16 20:16:23,Comment,1,"I can hear those brains talking from the trash can, give us some credit!"

2023-10-16 19:23:04,Comment,2,Whales who can make markets will do that!
2023-10-16 10:54:17,Comment,3,A couple of whales sold over 130k donuts which is responsible for our fall below 1.4
2023-10-16 10:53:28,Comment,3,"We all saw what r/place had in store for spez, that was amusing"
2023-10-16 10:52:18,Comment,1,"It’s good to have you back, I expect more shitposting with your schedule opened up!"
2023-10-16 10:49:50,Comment,2,"That’s true, they beat them to the punch… and it’s the beloved kraken of all things. Hasn’t stopped other memecoins from surviving on MEXC though, think a lot of liquidity is provided by the creators of those tokens"
2023-10-16 10:48:34,Comment,9,I just had to refresh my notifications over 7 times to see the replies to my comments. What is going on reddit? This bug has existed for months straight now with no breaks at all
2023-10-16 10:47:26,Comment,2,"Thanks! I’ll be happy enough to gain distributed moderation powers next distribution and help out the community. Are you new, from the RCP scene? Your username seems familiar"
2023-10-16 10:44:21,Comment,3,It’s hard to comprehend in the depths of a bear market just how crazy it can get in a bull run
2023-10-16 10:43:53,Comment,1,"We saw what happened to BTC last time the banks ran, spoiler alert it pumped! Wonder if we see a repeat?"
2023-10-16 10:42:45,Comment,2,"Ahh so BSC isn’t just rugs but hacks now, great to see the hackers are learning even more exploits!"
2023-10-16 10:41:30,Comment,3,Yeah the difference a draining work day makes on our motivation outside work. You know it’s been a good day when the comments just fly off the tongue afterwards! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32643)
2023-10-16 10:40:19,Comment,2,"Yes quite happy, wouldn’t even mind it if snapped now but it’s nice to have another week or so to go hard on the harvest!"
2023-10-16 10:39:22,Comment,2,They were on the MEXC equivalent of a probation period. A good excuse to delist them honestly. They basically went down completely from when they listed them so I don’t blame them
2023-10-16 10:38:33,Comment,2,"Yes, due to someone close to me I trust to be able to understand crypto enough to retrieve it for them. I don’t have much but whatever I have I’d want them to be able to get to it"
2023-10-16 10:37:28,Comment,2,Aww that’s good! Take some time to yourself and for your wife also! That’s really wholesome 🥹
2023-10-16 10:34:18,Comment,2,Yes I doubt he would get such little time. They need to show a harsh finger on this corruption especially in the crypto industry. Think how badly SK wants Do Kwon and I imagine it’s quite similar.
2023-10-16 10:32:49,Comment,2,I find it hard to believe that donuts would perform like bricks when their community barely knows how they work let alone like them. But we are in our own echo chamber for sure and we are shrimps!
2023-10-16 10:31:40,Comment,2,As long as he also pumps our massive bags
2023-10-16 10:30:16,Comment,2,"I found it hard to believe even. It is surreal having it be so professionalised but the customer base is exactly what you’d expect

How is your family?"

2023-10-16 10:19:28,Comment,2,"It went well! It was on Saturday. I also landed a gig as a pharmacy assistant at a medicinal cannabis dispensary, about a week in now. It’s been quite enjoyable so far! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)"
2023-10-16 10:17:51,Comment,3,The memes haven’t risen already? I wonder if we’ll ever see an end to memecoin seasons?
2023-10-16 10:16:50,Comment,3,"You’re right I suppose they aren’t really old reliable on that front. None yet but I haven’t had an opportunity for any bag the last few months! Will consider some stocks in the future, thanks!"
2023-10-16 10:15:32,Comment,2,Seeing those cards bounce around the screen leaving permanent shadows when you won… can’t be easily described
2023-10-16 10:14:35,Comment,4,Next bull run or perhaps an intense hype-fuelled CEX listing
2023-10-16 10:13:43,Comment,2,I don’t blame you for choosing solitaire as a pastime at all!
2023-10-16 10:12:38,Comment,2,"And for BTC to flip gold it’s like a 25x. I think it can be done! ETH needs a 75x? Come on, we can do it!"
2023-10-16 10:11:15,Comment,2,Progress is being made on the sugar rush front but somehow it isn’t quite the same as 11pm GMT was
2023-10-16 10:10:36,Comment,2,I love how your slacking off is still invested in earning crypto in your spare time ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-16 10:08:42,Comment,3,Looking forward to lumping some fiat into a bag of ETH and BTC. I know they are generic investments in this space but can’t go wrong with old reliable
2023-10-16 10:07:20,Comment,1,Two weeks and we will know. I think next year has a seriously great lineup of events as well in the longer term
2023-10-16 10:06:04,Comment,2,He knows how to have zero accountability and these rats know how to squirm into the path of least resistance. ADHD is a valid complaint to have but you can’t pin the rampant misuse of customers funds on a lack of executive function. If this succeeds in court the world needs serious help.
2023-10-16 10:03:35,Comment,2,Ugh I feel the grind happening now. It was nice to escape the rat race for a while sort of but damn this is how life is isn’t it? Wonder if we can flip that on its head in a few years?
2023-10-16 10:00:14,Comment,2,Damn you really believe in uptober don’t you?
2023-10-16 09:59:44,Comment,2,Can’t go wrong with these three. Jeez we are permabulls on donuts… it’s for good reason though right?
2023-10-16 09:58:48,Comment,3,Buy high complete… when sell low?
2023-10-16 09:58:10,Comment,2,Yes it is a temporary group that is analysed for performance as a low cap for a certain amount of days (I think 60?)
2023-10-16 09:57:24,Comment,3,Oh damn you really have an icon just for you! You’re very welcome mate looking good!
2023-10-16 09:24:41,Comment,1,Yes my 79 donuts might be lost forever at that time haha
2023-10-16 09:23:30,Comment,1,After $69m of course
2023-10-16 09:14:04,Comment,2,Prepare to complain that ETH is too deflationary and fees are too high
2023-10-16 09:13:25,Comment,3,Not a bad idea to provide clear information about this lately more well-known issue.
2023-10-16 08:52:59,Comment,2,Send me a DM with your address and I can send some DAI on gnosis
2023-10-16 08:52:30,Comment,3,"It's a relief to see green again. Wonder if we see BTC hit 30k, ETH 1600?"
2023-10-16 08:50:31,Comment,1,About time I’d say! Donuts deserve much more attention than they’ve got
2023-10-16 08:30:29,Comment,2,I hope to gain multiple ETH by then ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-16 08:25:53,Comment,3,I hope you're right my friend. Other RCPs have had quite a nice pump.
2023-10-16 08:23:33,Comment,2,We might see Bitcoin lead the way for a while yet. Still nice to stack the bags in the meantime
2023-10-16 08:22:51,Comment,4,*before* bull season? I like your optimism!

2023-10-16 02:31:37,Comment,1,ATH market cap here was $8m in 2021 blow off top. Moon ATH market cap was around $40m. Donuts still did a 30x or thereabouts following moon hype. But a listing will change so much for us!

2023-10-15 10:12:33,Comment,1,It’s real value *for now* perhaps. You could guess it’s priced in. But when the sentiment shifts its perceived value will again change

2023-10-15 10:10:15,Comment,2,"We could mention mistakes all we like, and that is a massive difference, but at the end of the day, BTC was a safe bet in comparison and it still is though ETH is now also the second-safest bet. I still bank on ETH, but you can say the same about the next alt that could 1000x in a future cycle"
2023-10-15 10:03:50,Comment,1,"It seems to be gaining traction in coneheads but that doesn’t mean the world. RCPswap has been around for moons for quite a while, it’s an OG service. I don’t know, people will have to make of it themselves"

2023-10-15 09:41:33,Comment,2,I’m learning Japanese and would love to visit with my partner one day! Would be beautiful
2023-10-15 09:40:39,Comment,2,"Agreed, I tend to avoid checking now, just keep up on the donut price as it’s talked about a lot in the daily."
2023-10-15 09:39:41,Comment,3,I’d hope they at least airdrop it directly to our wallets instead of us having to claim the drop. You’re right that they could’ve been more open with the moderation team about this
2023-10-15 09:38:28,Comment,3,Can’t argue with that ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)

2023-10-15 04:40:51,Comment,1,It was more than that haha around 100 a day in my case. I have a job now and can’t spend that much time!
2023-10-15 03:46:22,Comment,2,What’s a few percent compared to the next two years!
2023-10-15 03:45:39,Comment,2,Nope there aren’t any right now!
2023-10-15 03:41:31,Comment,2,"Karma based earnings each month depending on how much you comment and post in the sub. Be aware there is a donut penalty for making posts (not comments though).

Rewards are pretty good, with a lot of time last month I earned nearly 20k donuts, so around $270 USD for about 4k karma earned. A general trend is to try to make 50 comments a day in the daily"
2023-10-15 03:11:19,Comment,5,"To counter hyperinflation or skim past authoritarian control, crypto definitely is going to be a useful tool in countries like Venezuela"

2023-10-15 03:05:36,Comment,2,No alts I need to buy at the moment. I’ll earn donuts and buy BTC and ETH and that will keep me satisfied
2023-10-15 03:03:49,Comment,1,And ignore while they tell us they told us so now
2023-10-15 03:03:23,Comment,3,It is quite eery in here isn’t it?

2023-10-14 23:48:27,Comment,3,"Yes I think there’s still time to make decent earnings here, with ratios above 1. I wonder how many contributors we will gain this month?

I hope you can get that moderation by Christmas!"

2023-10-14 23:44:56,Comment,4,Looks like today will be the second day in this snapshot where we are under 4k comments.

2023-10-14 23:43:02,Comment,1,I’m earning them so far but it’s early days. Just got a job so I’m able to hold my donuts which is awesome 👏 ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644)

2023-10-14 22:55:20,Comment,2,"You’ll still gain some MOOND, in the post they say that users with below 1000 points on the distribution will gain 16, so 16 must be the minimum"

2023-10-14 22:52:32,Comment,1,I think you’ll dump it if you buy with that amount!

2023-10-14 21:56:50,Comment,3,"I’ve seen a bit of your work spreading to the coneheads community with mining rewards! It’s impressive and I’m glad to see an OG name like rcpswap still in development.

I’m curious about the top 100 donut holders airdrop. Will this be purely based on the blockchain top holdings (so including whales and those external to reddit) or is it more specific to the member’s earnings in this community?

Very curious to see how you guys go leading into your transition to arbnova!"

2023-10-14 21:45:04,Comment,2,"I’m not sure, the mods seemed to be aware of it when I saw it in a comment a few days ago, they were gonna kickstart the process. It might be a multisig event again so unsure about how that works"
2023-10-14 21:42:36,Comment,3,"Bruh, that razor sore throat is some of the worst pain ever while sick. I remember I couldn’t swallow I would just spit into a bucket for days, and the swallowing would wake me up from the pain. Take care brother"

As we saw for moons in 2021 there were often ratios as low as 0.4 with price being a few cents. Big news events might be required and a bullish market to have sustained demand."

2023-10-14 01:33:05,Comment,2,ETH was under 1k just last year. Almost under $100 in 2020. That is insane to imagine. Will we be scrambling to buy under $10k next cycle?
2023-10-14 01:10:28,Comment,2,Maybe around 3-4? It’s only a 20% rise in activity in perspective and last time was like 4.5

Fun facts. We have only gone below 4k comments once in this snapshot period so far, and that time was 3800+. We are averaging 4624 comments per daily this snapshot and last snapshot was 3948.

That, and a game with skins like in LoL or fortnite that sell like hotcakes. Fortnite for example does FOMO shops, imagine having a FOMO shop and the users can also trade the skins outside the FOMO shop to each other for their royalties? Sounds like $$$ to me"
2023-10-13 23:35:09,Comment,2,Ahh they really need to extend the tipping timer to like 2-6 hours in my opinion. I don’t think an hour is nearly long enough. How did people do this when activity was so low there was 10 comments in the daily??

2023-10-13 19:37:54,Comment,1,I wonder if this little (5%) donut dip is a fake-out before we go higher again? I miss the days of the 100% pump last month but I know we can’t ask for that every time. 100% gain is a phenomenal number but it feels like normality in the crypto space ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)

2023-10-13 08:43:57,Comment,2,That might require a CEX listing first!
2023-10-13 08:41:45,Comment,2,Did you actually upvote the 69 or was it just frozen at 69 from the rest of us trying to maintain it? ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-13 08:40:39,Comment,5,Aight I’ll see you next bull run! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-13 08:39:54,Comment,3,Send me your address and I’ll give you some DAI
2023-10-13 08:38:03,Comment,1,"Just one more day til your week is done bro, hit ‘em hard and don’t forget your toilet break donut mines"
2023-10-13 08:36:33,Comment,6,Where are you from? For science
2023-10-13 08:35:40,Comment,5,You can feel the excitement of a Friday with this energy!! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-13 08:33:38,Comment,4,Nice man! How far through your degree are you? I hope to see some development in this space!
2023-10-13 08:33:16,Comment,4,They’re still hanging around 13c. Wonder if they dump will the other RCP dump too?
2023-10-13 08:29:49,Comment,3,$200m market cap. Achievable in the bull run for sure
2023-10-13 08:29:13,Comment,3,We never fail to reach 69 in here. It’s getting past it that is the challenge
2023-10-13 08:28:43,Comment,4,You can sell a box with that amount mate!
2023-10-13 08:28:29,Comment,5,So who here has 15 tabs open on this sub? ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-13 08:26:50,Comment,2,"Yeah I’m done with iPhone, my contract has run out so when I have stable finances I’m going android next time!"
2023-10-13 08:21:26,Comment,2,We are averaging 4663 comments per daily this snapshot compared to 3948 last snapshot. Activity is still up
2023-10-13 08:19:31,Comment,2,He also probably has deep pockets in keeping the crypto market at bay as long as is required
2023-10-13 08:18:28,Comment,2,Probably the first time I’ve seen android release after iOS… especially in the crypto world
2023-10-13 08:17:51,Comment,3,"For donuts, we are. ATH market cap of just $8m in 2021!"
2023-10-13 08:02:26,Comment,2,Can’t say I’ve had a reddit dream yet but hopefully soon 😂
2023-10-13 08:00:50,Comment,2,And all holders if you buy now
2023-10-13 08:00:29,Comment,4,Damn you guys have commented a lot in the last 2 hours. Good to see our numbers climbing again! Is everyone ready for the weekend?? ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641) let’s have some more pumps on donuts!
2023-10-13 07:58:54,Comment,2,People will buy when all these failed projects pump 10x along with everything else. It’s hard to imagine right now but that’s gonna change in the bull again IMO
2023-10-13 07:57:49,Comment,2,"I had a problem, a big one haha ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
2023-10-13 05:33:30,Comment,2,They implemented KYC and it’s been downhill ever since
2023-10-13 05:33:14,Comment,1,"Especially compared to our user count which is actually in the top 1% of reddit, I think a lot of people left after the bull runs"
2023-10-13 05:32:29,Comment,3,What do you expect from Do Kwon’s company?
2023-10-13 05:32:09,Comment,3,"I think even though ETH killers are basically pronounced dead we will see them make a comeback in the euphoria of the bull, especially top 100s"
2023-10-13 05:31:37,Comment,2,It’s a busy Friday but the weekend is upon us!
2023-10-13 05:30:51,Comment,2,Ooof I can’t do that anymore ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640) have one for me!
2023-10-13 02:07:38,Comment,3,"It is possible to tip using mobile it is just convoluted. Visit the desktop page for reddit on a mobile browser, click the tip on the donut icon, copy the donut finance link into your MetaMask browser. (The reason to not do it on reddit directly in the MetaMask browser is because it loads gifs in an annoying way, you can try it if you want)"
2023-10-13 02:04:01,Comment,1,Yeah I can imagine it will be hard to commit to a DCA out in the bull run for this reason
2023-10-13 01:58:01,Comment,1,"The trust me bro, don’t underestimate that power"
2023-10-13 01:57:47,Comment,2,"I like to celebrate from the slightest positive news, it feels good in this bear market!"
2023-10-13 01:55:36,Comment,2,I mostly use XLM for this purpose as it is widely supported on most exchanges
2023-10-13 01:55:07,Comment,3,We’d all like to see them hit 1.7 first for sure
2023-10-13 00:17:39,Comment,2,Daily should come online in 10 minutes
2023-10-13 00:17:15,Comment,2,There was a prospect of making comments pay2comment. I don’t know about that change but it was interesting
2023-10-13 00:16:48,Comment,2,How so? I can see you!! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-12 21:43:42,Comment,2,"I think that’s very reasonable. $200m was almost the standard for many overhyped coins. MITH, an early SocialFi experiment, reached $100m in 2021"
2023-10-12 21:42:17,Comment,3,"I don’t believe that’s the case, maybe some false positives go through, but there’s usually a good reason. I think you’re being sarcastic however 😂"
2023-10-12 21:29:27,Comment,1,That sounds right. It did a 30x in like 1-2 days which is crazy
2023-10-12 21:26:28,Comment,3,I think they are following the RCP surge a bit
2023-10-12 21:25:56,Comment,1,I guess the contract wasn’t opened at the same time
2023-10-12 21:23:56,Comment,1,I think we are waiting on one signature
2023-10-12 21:23:33,Comment,1,I think it was some announcement like a Vitalik tweet or something. I can’t really remember. Someone here mentioned it a few weeks ago
2023-10-12 21:22:52,Comment,1,"It’s the OG memecoin, but it’s still a memecoin"
2023-10-12 21:21:02,Comment,2,Tokenomics and centralisation of USD are the worst in the crypto industry ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-12 14:49:44,Comment,2,Nothing would surprise me anymore. Tether is basically organised crime
2023-10-12 14:49:00,Comment,1,Agreed. It’s a perfect category like Metaverse was in 2021 to pump up big time next bull
2023-10-12 14:47:40,Comment,3,This. Bricks have a low liquidity as many of their users don’t even know how they work. So the market cap is probably functionally lower than it appears to be. Attractive for some whales to get involved
2023-10-12 14:46:19,Comment,1,"Finally our donuts getting some lovin that they deserved, after the other RCPs!"
2023-10-12 14:45:39,Comment,2,"It does happen from time to time. A tether depeg would be a good way to bring Circle back to the fore, among chaos ofc. It really was frustrating when USDC depeg when it was very close to interrupting the market share of tether"
2023-10-12 14:43:45,Comment,1,"I agree 100%. I think she actually does regret some of what happened. Keeping in mind she is saving her own skin and reducing her sentence, at least she has taken some accountability unlike SBF. She is still responsible for huge damage to the lives of millions though"
2023-10-12 14:35:50,Comment,1,!crypto donut
2023-10-12 14:35:01,Comment,2,Yeah if another one starts it up who are we to complain about tagging along? ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-12 14:34:10,Comment,3,Which makes $200m market cap an over 50x pump and I think that’s definitely a possibility next bull run if SocialFi gains more exposure and explodes
2023-10-12 14:31:43,Comment,2,I have barely gotten started til next week so I’d love some more accumulation time but I’d be happy for everyone if we blast off sooner ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)
2023-10-12 14:30:53,Comment,2,Wow she’s really not holding back anything in court. That’s a massive ouchie
2023-10-12 14:28:23,Comment,3,I like the donut swings on the micro cap. Guess we are following other RCPs a bit after all!
2023-10-12 10:09:59,Comment,1,"We can never truly know what the market will do, it’s a gamble and it will either go well or not 😊 next time!"
2023-10-12 10:03:59,Comment,2,We are going to see this with a microcap like donut currently has
2023-10-12 10:03:31,Comment,2,This is an honourable comment right here
2023-10-12 10:03:03,Comment,1,At least we can trace back with the crypto. It’s intended that way
2023-10-12 10:02:02,Comment,1,Feel like many of these insider type scenarios have happened with the amount of hacks in this bear market. How else are they gonna make a consistent profit with no market activity?
2023-10-12 10:01:01,Comment,2,All of us with degen history know this feeling. I stay far away from leverage these days
2023-10-12 10:00:11,Comment,2,Donuts have gotta be next. Or maybe they lead a delayed charge one month ago. I hope to see more upward movement since distribution!
2023-10-12 09:59:17,Comment,3,Sugar rush: when the daily opens. u/actuatorsif5
2023-10-12 09:58:19,Comment,2,"> What the worse that could happen?

Famous last words. /s

I’m so happy that you managed it all alone, must feel rewarding!"
2023-10-12 07:25:53,Comment,2,Surely it doesn’t take into account our current contrib and only what it is at snapshot but you might be right
2023-10-12 05:41:00,Comment,2,I think they just pumping from their downtrend like donuts did last month when they pumped 100%
2023-10-12 05:40:23,Comment,2,What advantage does waiting for governance score mean for your tips?
2023-10-12 05:39:39,Comment,3,Whales control the short term vision which is what they care about too ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-12 05:37:04,Comment,2,PEPECOMMUNITY is up on MEXC don’t miss out on this rug!!!
2023-10-12 05:36:35,Comment,2,My analysis is it will go up if it maintains its support
2023-10-12 05:35:57,Comment,5,Oh damn wish the other community points would respond. I guess every coin has their days
2023-10-12 05:35:30,Comment,1,Good time to save $1 on their 550 ETH transaction
2023-10-12 02:36:45,Comment,2,Good time to pick up some more. Anytime in the next now til listing is great
2023-10-12 02:34:06,Comment,1,You’d think it’s over by hanging in here rn! Just DCA for the next two years and we good
2023-10-12 02:33:32,Comment,1,I wouldn’t mind seeing <$1k ETH one more time but we might have missed that opportunity a year ago
2023-10-12 02:29:09,Comment,1,The biggest weakness is social engineering or otherwise human error with these. It can be so risky to use a password manager for this sensitive data
2023-10-12 02:26:29,Comment,1,"I avoid looking at the charts now myself too. Just donuts! Doing well, on lunch break. I’m glad you’re feeling good mate! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)"
2023-10-12 02:25:35,Comment,1,"It sure is, at least work is very quiet today! Stay dry mate!"
2023-10-12 00:29:10,Comment,1,If he took some accountability maybe he could’ve even been the one to cut a deal. It’s the only thing she can do
2023-10-12 00:27:37,Comment,3,A new daily! Great time to come out on my fiat break. How is everyone doing today? It’s very very wet down here but staying warm
2023-10-12 00:26:52,Comment,3,Octover checking in haha. I don’t mind a few more months of accumulation to be honest
2023-10-12 00:25:23,Comment,1,You’re very welcome my friend. It’s hard to gather upvotes at this time
2023-10-11 21:53:29,Comment,3,I loved hearing the term Octover 😂 I’m not about predicting a monthly outcome by the past performance but it was funny nonetheless
2023-10-11 21:51:36,Comment,2,I hope we see a moon/donut pair on the reddit marketplace in the future
2023-10-11 21:50:54,Comment,2,That was pretty hilarious to watch and it’s the only gold I’ve seen over the entirety of reddit
2023-10-11 21:50:13,Comment,3,The bull will be faster and with intense positive emotions. A wild ride for sure but it might be harder to stick to a DCA out plan than we realise
2023-10-11 21:40:24,Comment,2,"Begun, the tipping wars have ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644) thanks for this post!"
2023-10-11 21:37:56,Comment,1,0.1 BTC I believe!
2023-10-11 20:27:53,Comment,2,How do you check this? Is this on the dashboard sorting by tips?
2023-10-11 20:26:58,Comment,2,Jeez these “white hats” are really making a killing this bear market
2023-10-11 19:26:03,Comment,3,"Hyperinflation is where it is most useful right now, alongside authoritarian control. These are the countries we will probably see substantial growth in over the next few years"
2023-10-11 19:23:52,Comment,1,They really just went on a huge power trip didn’t they?
2023-10-11 19:22:21,Comment,2,It’s going to be possible. Some people would’ve earned life changing money from the BTC faucets!
2023-10-11 10:30:49,Comment,2,Wtf twisties have been doing some weird shit lately. Wonder how they taste?
2023-10-11 10:29:55,Comment,3,Satoshi. “We need you dude!”
2023-10-11 10:25:10,Comment,2,And then we shall not pass!!
2023-10-11 10:24:03,Comment,2,"My partner is incredible too, it gives hope and focus to my vision. I’m so happy you have an amazing family to guide you!"
2023-10-11 10:22:13,Comment,3,About 4.5
2023-10-11 10:21:41,Comment,5,It might be even be lower than last distribution as we are still averaging over 900 more comments per daily
2023-10-11 10:17:07,Comment,2,This is someone with a good sense of their priorities. We really can learn a thing or two from sensei
2023-10-11 10:16:00,Comment,2,Maybe it has something to do with contrib not being distributed yet?
2023-10-11 10:15:24,Comment,2,Yes the waiting game is going to continue. These ups and downs are nothing compared to what’s coming in the next couple of years
2023-10-11 10:14:55,Comment,2,Halloween themed donut emojis I would love too
2023-10-11 10:14:40,Comment,3,Damn I really gotta bring donuts into work someday. Hopefully don’t come across like dexter but it would be satisfying!
2023-10-11 10:08:51,Comment,3,I didn’t realise it was so bad. I haven’t posted in over a week and that was my first time. I think timing is key but you might be getting targeted
2023-10-11 10:06:32,Comment,1,"Private accounts with proof of transactions sounds like a nice system. I mean it is bad not being able to trace back these style of transactions but a system with privacy where you can still prove you made certain transactions as evidence, sounds great"
2023-10-11 10:04:30,Comment,2,Usually they are posted later tonight or perhaps it’s actually the morning. The most recent one was posted in the last daily (this morning in aus) from memory
2023-10-11 10:03:23,Comment,2,Switching networks baits us into feeling rich for a few moments every single time
2023-10-11 10:02:54,Comment,1,It favours the puppeteer generals playing war games
2023-10-11 10:02:00,Comment,2,"Not sarcasm, respect the many people that ruined their lives with memecoins!"
2023-10-11 10:01:25,Comment,3,I think a lot of us spend time purely in the daily at this point. We need more organic growth outside of it
2023-10-11 09:02:04,Comment,2,Jeez we are already 2 weeks from snapshot? That’s crazy man
2023-10-11 09:01:12,Comment,2,"Looks like bot is asleep but yes find gnosis chain, add the details. Then import the donut token on coingecko :)"
2023-10-11 08:59:25,Comment,2,Hmm I hope we can do better than that!
2023-10-11 08:57:03,Comment,2,I hope your feelings become reality. And I hope we get a listing next year too.
2023-10-11 08:55:22,Comment,2,"On the sub it is your mainnet donuts. Have you looked on Gnosis chain?

Type !balance"
2023-10-11 08:52:52,Comment,2,Sounds awesome man I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) enjoy your final weekend!!
2023-10-11 07:06:23,Comment,1,Our DCA believes in these prices
2023-10-11 07:06:07,Comment,3,We need our whale friends. 1m donuts seems like a dream to acquire now
2023-10-11 05:33:51,Comment,2,"Yeah perfect, that’s good to hear. What a milestone mate![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)"
2023-10-11 05:33:19,Comment,2,It’s going well! Getting the hang of things. Much busier today but it’s been good man thanks for asking! Are you still on holiday or back at the office?
2023-10-11 05:31:32,Comment,3,"Oh wow, bull run confirmed! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32641)"
2023-10-11 05:31:12,Comment,2,"Buy when there’s blood in the streets! It’s only 1550, I mean we were at <1k ETH a year ago…"
2023-10-11 05:30:25,Comment,2,"Payday is coming, only a week or so! Can’t wait to start DCA ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32636)"
2023-10-11 05:30:00,Comment,2,You waiting to get the 20k moderation? Congrats!
2023-10-11 05:29:15,Comment,1,Who needs hacks when you have a bear market right?
2023-10-11 02:27:07,Comment,3,"It’s gotten a lot of hate and criticism, I think RCPs are still segregated from it but I assume people would have a similar reaction to the publication of RCPs at the current time."
2023-10-11 02:22:32,Comment,2,"You’re right, she would’ve stayed quiet and indifferent. In the end she still contributed to the crimes and ruined many lives with the reckless behaviour"
2023-10-11 02:20:26,Comment,5,Oh 10c for sure. That’s a $20m market cap. I expect a $200m market cap is possible in the bull market bringing us to $1.
2023-10-11 02:19:44,Comment,1,Everyone has a food coma now ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-11 02:17:45,Comment,2,I can’t unsee that now…
2023-10-11 02:17:13,Comment,2,At least she showed an ounce of accountability compared to SBF. Doesn’t really change anything in the end though
2023-10-11 02:16:27,Comment,2,So that’s why everyone left ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)
2023-10-11 02:15:50,Comment,2,You don’t speak for me. I will cuddle!
2023-10-11 02:14:20,Comment,2,Helping where I can on my lunch break ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) at least we have donut liquidity today
2023-10-11 02:13:59,Comment,1,I’d prefer Bitcoin Inu to SV any day!
2023-10-11 02:13:20,Comment,2,I hope so I’m nearly ready to begin DCA
2023-10-11 02:10:09,Comment,2,We get an airdrop every month! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) no need for more!
2023-10-11 00:05:35,Comment,2,It’s going to be an adjustment to the new time for the daily for sure
2023-10-11 00:02:58,Comment,2,"Fair effort fellas, almost 4800 comments today. Guess everyone is excited about that sugar injection! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) checking in from the fiat mine, hope you’re all having a great day!"
2023-10-11 00:00:06,Comment,1,We might see below 1c but I don’t think it would stay under that for very long at all. Maybe keep some spare fiat ready ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644)
2023-10-10 23:59:24,Comment,2,"We haven’t got the contrib yet, it seems to be delayed"
2023-10-10 23:59:02,Comment,1,"Yes, as annoying as they are it’s best to just hide them"
2023-10-10 23:58:42,Comment,1,And banano is really cool. Loved folding to mine as a hobby and they have a great tipping culture
2023-10-10 21:52:27,Comment,3,That’s dedication to the donut cause right there. Sleep tight! What an exciting day!
2023-10-10 21:51:26,Comment,3,It’s nice to have a day of euphoria each month even in these uncertain times ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32645)

2023-10-10 20:10:57,Comment,4,"Donuts are down another 10% to $0.013 and none of us have a care in the world! With all that freshly baked goodness, who would?"
2023-10-10 20:09:40,Comment,2,You need to do it on desktop reddit through the flair section
2023-10-10 20:09:14,Comment,2,In your connected MetaMask on the Gnosis chain
2023-10-10 20:08:45,Comment,2,It’s just the tip bro!

2023-10-10 20:06:57,Comment,4,Omg it’s happening! It’s happening! Congrats to you all ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639) we eating today
2023-10-10 10:25:30,Comment,1,Buy signal confirmed. I joke but it might actually be a sign we are close to the bottom to hear this written. Thanks for providing your unpopular opinion
2023-10-10 10:23:40,Comment,2,Oh we’ll be getting some nuts soon enough
2023-10-10 10:23:21,Comment,2,The only winners are the egos of the warmongers pulling the strings
2023-10-10 10:09:35,Comment,1,It did temporarily 😂 life wasn’t in the best shape during but it was a good buffer
2023-10-10 10:05:23,Comment,2,"Accidentally in 2021. It happened to correlate with times I had financial hardship and dug into crypto, I DCAed out the entire second peak which was lucky. Still got rekt in 2022. It’s kinda hard to ignore the euphoria anyway, definitely more difficult than with a bear market DCA in"
2023-10-10 09:54:27,Comment,1,True although there’s merit in continued publication of behaviour like this. People deserve to get their money back from these events and the influencers shouldn’t face zero consequences for their actions
2023-10-10 09:52:31,Comment,1,"That’s the way, it’s not costly and quality content deserves a reward. The more of us tipping small amounts makes it a great pool overall for our contributors!"
2023-10-10 09:51:02,Comment,2,I expect mods are considered very very carefully in all RCP subreddits now.
2023-10-10 09:50:18,Comment,1,They’re leaving it up to the L2s in the meantime ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)
2023-10-10 09:49:35,Comment,3,It’s in the contract https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=gno:0x682b5664C2b9a6a93749f2159F95c23fEd654F0A
2023-10-10 09:45:36,Comment,2,"That’s the great thing is you can do whatever you want with them here. I’m gonna hold onto them for a bit now that I have a fiat mine, and go wherever this road leads ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32649)"
2023-10-10 09:44:28,Comment,3,Wow mate that is a hefty bag you’ve grown. Keep it up! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32644)
2023-10-10 09:43:45,Comment,2,"I don’t even look at it, that’s how small the gas fees are. Some kind soul gave me 50c DAI and I’m still at over 49"
2023-10-10 09:42:41,Comment,3,"They do for moons and bricks for sure, and it’s a heftier amount"
2023-10-10 09:42:11,Comment,3,Only 80k of the 2.3m in distribution!
2023-10-10 09:36:02,Comment,2,Octover I haven’t actually seen but I find that hilarious. Anyway it’s best to not peg months with names. We’re in it for what the next few years have for us
2023-10-10 09:35:15,Comment,2,All three of them just happen to be my uncles on speed dial. I’ll be back with their word
2023-10-10 09:34:29,Comment,1,Sounds like a great and balanced life you’re living! Keep it up ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-10 09:22:24,Comment,2,"Just like the charts, keeps us on our toes!"
2023-10-10 09:21:40,Comment,3,"As buffet says, the markets are the movement of money from the impatient to the patient"
2023-10-10 09:20:59,Comment,3,"I think mods of the sub but I’m not certain on that. I don’t think aminok is one for example, but I might also be wrong on that"
2023-10-10 09:15:21,Comment,2,Not quite! 500 donuts off 😂 next month for sure!
2023-10-10 09:08:22,Comment,2,I want to nominate this comment! It would be great to have it visible on the front page as donuts are super close now! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-10 09:07:16,Comment,1,Hanging onto it and its confirmation bias with cherry picked correlations is risky IMO
2023-10-10 09:04:45,Comment,1,It’s not too bad. Ethereum is already tickling 1600 again. Shame for donuts though but we just have to keep believing and earning ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-10 09:04:04,Comment,3,What if I sell my $10? That should offset that chaos
2023-10-10 09:01:21,Comment,2,"You can see the emotions of the market, and the overall sentiment in real time in daily threads like this ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)"
2023-10-10 09:00:42,Comment,2,I don’t have one haha that’s how I’d put it. I think people with office jobs can get away with some reddit on the side
2023-10-10 08:58:56,Comment,1,"10 distributions with a fair amount of time invested, it seems reasonable. Depending on growth from here. It may be the best time to earn donuts right now and until a listing comes."
2023-10-10 08:58:05,Comment,3,They have seriously been a blessing in this bear market. A free DCA to keep us motivated is incredible
2023-10-10 08:57:20,Comment,2,It breaks my heart that Bitcoin SV in in the top 100
2023-10-10 08:55:11,Comment,3,That’s the most disgusting red flag of those coins named that way
2023-10-10 08:53:21,Comment,3,"Thanks for this, I have been looking for it for ages!"
2023-10-10 08:52:55,Comment,2,We gotta be so close now. I can taste them… I think! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32639)
2023-10-10 08:52:32,Comment,3,"Nice, great order to have sitting there! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32636)"
2023-10-10 08:26:03,Comment,2,"Sounds similar to mine, I think a sore back will come with time for me too. It's hard to stand up straight all day. Take care of yourself!!"
2023-10-10 08:24:46,Comment,2,"Dual mining is indeed very difficult. We do get 2 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break, plus toilet breaks, so that will have to do. That is so awesome that you can reddit at the desk!"
2023-10-10 08:23:53,Comment,4,![gif](giphy|j2GLSp9qUpcTfv4w11|downsized)
2023-10-10 08:21:40,Comment,1,That would change each and every one of our lives!
2023-10-10 08:18:38,Comment,2,"Nah not really, just a mostly standing job and I have not done a lot of moving around the past few months I gotta admit! Having good form is very important, what do you do?"
2023-10-10 08:17:10,Comment,2,"Arbitrum is the only one, and it was unexpected and a life saver."
2023-10-10 08:13:49,Comment,7,"Day 1 at the fiat mine is now over. It went well everyone, I did the thing! My legs now hurt. Time to focus on how great it would be to exit the rat race again ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32640)"
2023-10-10 08:11:29,Comment,1,"If I could go back in time, I would pass up on BTC, ETH and donuts. Who would buy those shitcoins?"
2023-10-10 05:46:16,Comment,2,At least 69 we have to make that
2023-10-10 05:45:22,Comment,2,"It’s too hard to predict. They’ve been quite volatile beforehand, but last time they pumped"
2023-10-10 00:03:56,Comment,2,Can confirm they are inside me rn
2023-10-10 00:03:44,Comment,1,It’s so unpredictable now!
2023-10-10 00:01:06,Comment,3,I got it mate!!! 😊 thanks for asking! I hope you have a great day!
2023-10-10 00:00:45,Comment,2,"Oh yeah you’re right, should grab em the doughies! ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32638)"
2023-10-09 23:27:07,Comment,4,"Daily is coming one hour delayed from yesterday onwards, to reflect the correct date 😊

On a coffee run for the job, it’s good being the new guy ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32638)"
