2023-10-27 13:23:49,Comment,"ETH staking is currently 3.2% on Exodus -I'm sure there is a slight fee that comes from the Validator to maintain operational costs - but a quick look seems to be right on par with Coinbases reward rate, they show 3.25% currently

Staking ADA with Exodus is still done on-chain, but they just don't let you choose what your stake pool is, by default you will go through Everstake which will include their only slight fee on top of the 340 block rewards the pool requires - and also incurs the same epoch waiting period before rewards accrue.",5
2023-10-27 13:19:45,Comment,"No, I don't think so if I understand correctly.

You will accumulate ETH in rewards which will automatically added to your stake amount until you are ready to unstake.

There is no need to convert 'steth' to eth or anything of the sort afterwards

You still pay the GAS fee to execute the action, and I believe the only difference is you are trusting Exodus for their smart contract, versus signing off and trusting Rocketpool/LIDO

Which is slightly different to how 'Staking as a Service' works with a CEX.",3

2023-10-20 11:39:38,Comment,"I was always skeptical of moons ever reaching $1.00 to be honest - due to the nature of monthly distribution and sell pressure.

I was going to slowly exit the liquidity pool around March 2024 (That would mark about 12 months of providing liquidity, and the yield rewards wouldve reduced by then)

From March 2024, I would have DCA out, complying with the 75% holding rule - and then I would have exited at the next pump above 50c (assuming there mightve been another exchange listing)

I guess I'm just thankful I did secure some profits after the Kraken listing pumped moons to 50c+ - I would be walking away with even less than the 6.4k I did had I not done that.

This was all part of my plan of hoping to by a house by the end of 2024.",5

I think is especially true for those who had been mods from near the start of moons and before moons were even introduced.  


Certainly a higher rate of 'trading' moons from those who became a mod in the last 24 months, compared to those 25months+",7

2023-10-20 10:37:08,Comment,"Before I went to sleep, when Reddit life was still good. I believe I had about 92k moons + 12 ETH in the LP.

6 of that ETH was supplied by my own funding, and 6 of that ETH was taken from moons sold at 50c.

By the time I woke up, and the slaughtering had already happened, my LP: position was at 221k moons  and about 4.5 ETH

Unfortunately, that Imperma loss had to become permanent if i wanted to walk away with anything.

I proceeded to withdraw liquidity, and sell, in a slight panic, at the bottom of about 3.2c... but I had just woken up, and had to get to work, so I did it in one lump sum, incurring a good 10% slippage.

The grand total value of my wallet after all that was 10 ETH - meaning after 3 years of contributing to the sub, I have walked away with about 4 ETH profit.... $6.4k ""income"" over 3 years if you want to call it that.

I reckon my ATH wallet value was about 55k though üò¨",11
2023-10-20 10:22:53,Comment,"As much as it stings, and I too was someone who was within the top50 moon earners of all time (based on governance  votes), and top 5 liquidity providers.

You still walked away with profit. It might not feel like much, especially knowing what the ATH high portfolio value was... but shit hit the fan, and you still walked away with profit in a bear market.
