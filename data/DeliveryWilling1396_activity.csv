2023-10-09 16:47:22,Comment,3,"3 reasons why Ethereum price can‚Äôt break $2K.. 

1)Ethereum price paints bear cycle fractal.
Ethereum‚Äôs inability to cross above $2,000 in 2023 resembles the bearish rejection near $425 from 2018 to 2019.
2)Stronger U.S. dollar, Bitcoin
A strengthening United States dollar has dampened demand for Ethereum in recent months, thus reducing its ability to close decisively above $2,000.
3)Ethereum network activity dips.
The total value locked (TVL) across the Ethereum ecosystem has dropped from 18.41 million ETH to 12.79 million ETH so far in 2023. That underscores a reduced availability of funds, resulting in lower yields for investors, as JP Morgan analysts also warned recently."

#2 Dogecoin (DOGE)

Next on our list is Dogecoin, but only on a technicality. Dogecoin was trading around $.10 before the collapse of FTX due to the hype of Elon Musk buying Twitter.
