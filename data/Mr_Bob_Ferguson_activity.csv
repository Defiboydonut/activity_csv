2023-10-28 00:19:27,Comment,2,"Deal!

The answer is “no, I don’t know”.

(Dammit, I was meant to take the moons first before telling you the answer, right?)"
2023-10-28 00:14:22,Comment,2,"Is this a meme or a self-help infographic?

I don’t like it and feel targeted."
2023-10-28 00:13:18,Comment,2,For the right price I’ll give you an answer to that question.
2023-10-27 21:31:09,Comment,2,"That is not the same as “karma” data.

They are slightly different things.

Karma is a secret formula, known only by Reddit, and not possible to be calculated by members or mods.

The data calculated by members is based on upvotes, which gets maybe 95% of the way, but to be clear is a different type of calculation.

I’m not suggesting that the member calculations shouldn’t be considered for use, only that it would be a “new way of calculating”."
2023-10-27 20:46:45,Comment,3,"Have Reddit admins provided the “karma” data?

Or are you referring to Reddito’s data which is based on upvotes?

They are slightly different datasets.

Using Redditos data will be very close, but it is a change to the calculation method.

Reddit “karma” data uses a secret formula which only Reddit knows."
2023-10-26 20:00:30,Comment,1,"Crypto Queen Ruva?

Logan Paul?

We have more main ones to go."
2023-10-26 11:53:56,Comment,1,…and to yourself!
2023-10-26 10:08:32,Comment,1,">Report them to Reddit as Spam

Or report them to mods as breaking sub rules, which often gets things fixed up faster than relying on the reddit overlords."
2023-10-26 10:07:29,Comment,1,">Honor system.

Sounds fair enough.

I did find it strange that I was only one who received karma this round.

But we have to be truthful."
2023-10-26 10:06:16,Comment,1,">they cant fuck us anymore

I love your optimism.

But also find it extremely misled!

There are a million ways that reddit can nuke this sub and everything that goes with it. The key is to work out how to remove the reliance on reddit to survive."
2023-10-26 10:03:21,Comment,1,"Unfortunately reddit has the power to pull any move on any sub at any time.

To see true staying power for Donuts, and all other community tokens, it will all come down to determining additional external use-cases so that they can survive even without the sub."
2023-10-26 09:58:49,Comment,8,I feel like reddito is pulling a little more weight than the rest of us though!
2023-10-26 09:55:24,Comment,7,"I believe that this photo is a fake, it has been photoshopped.

Reddito doesn’t have a baby."
2023-10-26 08:32:34,Comment,1,"""Karma"" is a secret formula, made up of upvotes/downvotes and a sprinkle of secret sauce relating to user behaviour which reddit doesn't communicate.

This data is provided by reddit admins to the sub mods.

Instead the alternative is that they will need to move to a new model based on data which regular users (those who are not employees of reddit) can access, which is the data regarding upvotes. Anyone can extract that data, if they have the knowledge.

The numbers will be similar, but still different."

Huh?

So you're really expecting it to play out as:

1. You post an image showing a scam on Twitter
2. ETH Trader member sees the image, thinks it's genuine and that Elon is giving away crypto
3. ETH Trader member then manually types in the URL shown in the photo

Best of luck with that!"
2023-10-26 05:06:19,Comment,2,"Sure.

I’m just pointing out that it would be a change."
2023-10-26 01:55:08,Comment,3,"Nobody but Reddit has official karma data.

Other upvote data can be used to provide similar results, but it’s not “the same” as karma.

Karma is a secret internal Reddit calculation."
2023-10-25 01:35:36,Comment,2,"If this happened in /cc/ and you killed their Daily, you would have had a contract out on your head.

Lucky this sub is much more forgiving!"
2023-10-24 09:18:43,Comment,5,"The shift happened approximately 3 days after the price crash.

Comments went from “upvote by default” to the more traditional “cc” voting behavior.

Sad how quickly it changed.

Thats what happens when you get people who are only participating “for the money”, but have no interest in the actual subject."
2023-10-23 04:50:30,Comment,9,"Don't jump to conclusions and take it so personally.

It was actually intended to be [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/).

&#x200B;

edit: It appears reddit have killed this hyperlink in the last couple of weeks. End of an era for this joke."
2023-10-23 03:08:33,Comment,1,And there’s also often an element of money laundering in many of the high bids.
2023-10-23 03:01:10,Comment,2,"Alternative:

- Sushi to swap Moon to ETH (arbitrum nova)
- Orbiter Finance to change ETH from arbitrum nova to ethereum network
- Uniswap to swap ETH to Donuts (on ETH)

Takes a few more steps of course, but works as a temporary fix!"
2023-10-22 23:09:11,Comment,3,"Accepting payment in donuts makes it easier members of this sub, as well as also makes the NFT market more liquid.

Earn here, spend there.

Easy."
2023-10-22 23:07:51,Comment,1,"It’s always easier to buy straight in whichever token you have, instead of needing to swap tokens or bridge chains first.

Unless rcax are accepting donuts on Gnosis?"
2023-10-22 21:17:03,Comment,1,Expansion would be extremely bullish for donut prices!
2023-10-22 08:02:56,Comment,2,"They excluded dust with an ETH balance less than 0.00001 ETH.

I’d be keen to see how the numbers drop off if it were a more meaningful “as good as zero” balance of 0.001 or less (a little over a dollar).

Once you are down below $10 it’s normally more hassle than it is worth to do anything but leave it!"
2023-10-22 00:55:04,Comment,1,"It would be nice if this was the cause, as then at least the price drop is somewhat explained.

As it doesn't make sense that Donuts didn't at least partially recover after the massive drop a few days ago."
2023-10-21 20:28:57,Comment,2,"> This is not the right way to disconnect OP. You have to disconnect through Revoke or Debank.

Are you referring to the person who created the post, or the comment that you replied to?

As what is mentioned by /u/kirtash93 (use revoke.cash or similar) is correct, and also what you seem to be saying?"
2023-10-21 20:26:57,Comment,3,"There’s got to be a lot more to this story right?

At the least, it shows that the market is being gamed by some clever people."
2023-10-21 11:20:14,Comment,1,"This event will be quickly forgotten.

It’s a bit like Logan Paul. He doesn’t care about screwing over his followers, as new ones just keep coming to replace them."
2023-10-21 11:18:33,Comment,1,"> You can't imagine how much regret I would have after taking literally no profits ever on MOONS...

I have a pretty fair idea!"
2023-10-21 10:45:46,Comment,1,"> jump to conclusions

That would make a good name for a game, where you could actually “jump” to conclusions."
2023-10-21 01:48:46,Comment,2,People on the internet always love to talk about suing each other and pretend that it’s as easy as filling out a web form with no risks or fees attached!
2023-10-21 01:30:21,Comment,3,"With the expected ratio would any posts realistically earn 250 donuts to offset the cost?

Or is there other ways that you don’t pay the fee? Eg: post engagement."
2023-10-21 01:24:40,Comment,1,"Donuts right now have a relatively known way forward.

Moons are up in the air while waiting on answers."
2023-10-21 01:23:05,Comment,1,"That’s probably a “stretch”.

It’s multiples of the previous ATH.

But you never know with crypto."
2023-10-20 22:28:18,Comment,1,"Ahh ok, so 12 ETH, rather than 12 different types of coins which are built on Ethereum.

Got ya!

That changed things as far as the stability of projects."
2023-10-20 22:26:12,Comment,1,"Great idea.

/proceeds to be exit liquidity for the whale."
2023-10-20 22:25:32,Comment,2,"But that title wouldn’t get clicks!

Dude sees price collapsing and has the opportunity to take a guaranteed profit or continue with the gamble.

He took profit."
2023-10-20 22:22:13,Comment,1,"Nobody can answer the question for you.

You haven’t stated which coins these are, we have no idea about how strong the projects may be.

We have no idea what else you own outside of crypto.

Taking at least small profits along the way rarely hurts anyone though."
2023-10-20 22:18:32,Comment,2,"This is not the Netflix documentary that we expected, but the one we deserved."
2023-10-20 22:17:46,Comment,1,"> Why are these news outlets not pointing out the mistake done on Reddit's part?

**Devils Advocate:** Reddit are a business. They cancelled a project because a different project (the new reward system) is more profitable for them.

I don’t agree with it at all, and I lost a lot of
money on paper, but this is the reality."
2023-10-20 22:15:40,Comment,4,"Realistically though, who is going to bring on this lawsuit and take on the financial burden of doing so?

Asking hundreds of anonymous users, across multiple countries, to dox themselves in the process, over laws that may or may not have been broken over the early sale of governance tokens.

It is shit, it is unethical, but even though I lost a lot of money on paper in this I wouldn’t be betting on the success of a law suit."
2023-10-20 22:09:18,Comment,1,"You never know when an airdrop could pay off big time!

…but also as per the mod disclaimer, when connecting your wallet could see you get hosed!"
2023-10-19 21:43:21,Comment,2,"We like to say that, but they will!"
2023-10-19 21:42:56,Comment,1,">I hope you didn't spend money on moons though

Only thousands of hours!

We'll see what happens over there. I enjoy the topics in that sub too, so want to continue there as well."
2023-10-19 08:14:18,Comment,3,"Familiar names everywhere.

The Reddit crypto community is huge, yet tiny at the same time!"
2023-10-19 08:11:46,Comment,3,"Ahh fantastic! I actually read that paragraph earlier today, but it must not have sunk in at the time.

Good system. Particularly regarding liquidity pools still counting for governance."
2023-10-19 08:01:38,Comment,2,"My exit was terrible.

Lost a LOT on paper yesterday.

Oh well, knew it was always a possibility."
2023-10-19 07:04:36,Comment,2,"This is something that has surprised me over on the crypto currency sub many times.

People happily spend months posting, but haven't taken the time to read the wiki to find out how things work.

At least you've wisened up now!"
2023-10-19 07:02:41,Comment,3,"That's true.

There is a big lack of awareness about how not just donuts work, but also moons and bricks. People were happy to spend hours involved in the subs in order to earn them, but weren't happy to spend a while to read wikis and learn the rules of how they worked.

If it's only those mis-informed buyers who sold, then I predict that donut prices will recover relatively quickly."
2023-10-19 06:43:04,Comment,2,"A couple of questions if I may:

1- Are the 3 featured threads on the right sidebar the only ones to take note of, or are there others too which are important to understand?

2- Do donuts held on ethereum (as opposed to gnosis) count towards ""re-buying governance power"" if you sell your gnosis earned donuts?"
2023-10-19 06:37:51,Comment,2,"> Back in days where ratio was 125

Good grief!

The numbers are insane, but I guess of course the upvotes at the time were near impossible to find."
2023-10-19 06:27:26,Comment,2,"The contract for DONUT isn't controlled by reddit admin.

The ones for MOON and BRICK are though.

So while reddit has a level of control over the reporting provided to the mods of this sub and sub rules (they could make life difficult), they can't kill DONUT, as they can the other two."
2023-10-19 06:18:53,Comment,1,"Can confirm.

They were too desirable not to buy."
2023-10-19 06:17:04,Comment,7,">I can see after the initial dump, donuts have been recovering now.

It didn't make sense to me that DONUTS dumped so hard, when they weren't an official RCP controlled by Reddit.

...so I bought DONUTS."
