2023-10-25 02:56:23,Comment,2,Sounds like they're still waiting to hear back from Reddit. Sounds like best case scenario if reddit doesn't release moons to them.
2023-10-25 02:53:45,Comment,5,2 day later.....so can I have my job back?
2023-10-25 02:01:53,Comment,3,Nice to see everything is doing well today. Moons enjoying a nice pump after the latest post from MODs. Donuts not looking to shabby today either.
