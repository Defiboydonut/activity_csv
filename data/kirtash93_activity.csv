2023-10-26 06:32:14,Comment,11,"Let see the positive side of Reddit not even giving the CSV. We now have ""full"" control of when, how, etc. is calculated.

I think it is time to put some meat on the grill and push this new feature to be developed to not have to do it manually. I personally think that u/reddito321 is our quickest chance to develop it in the less time and I also think that he must be paid for the time, effort and development that he is and will put into this.

The only ""automatic"" way I can think right now to circumvent the Reddit 1000 API is to build a cronjob that retrieves the data per user that has a registered wallet to earn DONUTs every day or every 2-5 days to reduce the amount of calls.

After we have this data, we just safe it in a database removing duplicated comments and its done.

Regarding other things, I think that all the code related to DONUTs should end in [https://github.com/EthTrader](https://github.com/EthTrader) and that everybody should be able to add developments after a QA security level passes. If we want to be decentralized, we should follow that path."

Then all the tips IN/OUT per user are summarized and the result of that is deducted or added to the distribution DONUTs.

2023-10-23 18:24:06,Comment,3,"Am I the only one that is going to miss the Special membership?

Is there any kind of idea to make the special membership outside Reddit? For example, GIFs feature could be still for special members. I think it can be easy to develop it. Instead of burning the DONUTs would be nice to have an specific wallet where all the special membership can go and that stash be used for future developments or whatever.

In fact it is just necessary a little DB to save the username, the time and the crypto payment mechanism. Then add some features for only mods to be able to check things, a cronjob to trigger a bot to send alert or remove the special membership and it is done.

I also think that special membership should be given for the ones that already have it. I suggest all the people to take an screenshot of the special membership in Reddit just in case in the future someone needs proof for that.

* Connecting MetaMask ONLY asks to see the public addresses.
* Claiming process only ask to accept the contract to send you the coins without any kind of approval. You can check after with [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) that you will have nothing to revoke.
* I checked the contract code and it is a really simple contract and there is anything weird on it.

Insider trading definition: Insider trading refers to the illegal practice of buying or selling a item (such as stocks, bonds, options, crypto or other financial instruments) based on material, non-public information about the company that issued the item. This information is considered ""inside"" information because it has not been made available to the general public.

2023-10-21 18:00:48,Comment,9,"**How to see your DONUTs in MetaMask**

I see that we have some newcomers and are asking how see/add Donuts and I bring you this easy tutorial:

**Concepts:**

We have ""two"" Donuts:

* The ones in mainnet (Ethereum Network) that are the ones you can see in the icon in Reddit and the ones that are used to pay the Special Membership
* The ones in Gnosis chain that are the ones received every Distribution and used to tip people thanks to the extreme low fees. How to Add Donuts in Ethereum Network to your MM: This one is easy, just go to [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/donut/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/donut/) and click in the MM icon in Contracts section to add Donuts token. Remember to have ETH network selected in your MetaMask (MM)

**How to Add Donuts in Ethereum Network to your MM:**

1. First you need to add Gnosis Chain to MetaMask following this tutorial [https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/how-to-add-gnosis-chain-to-metamask](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/how-to-add-gnosis-chain-to-metamask)
2. Second, you need to add Donuts token to Gnosis chain. Remember to have Gnosis chain network selected in your MetaMask (MM). You can add DONUTs easily with [https://gnosis.blockscout.com/token/0x524b969793a64a602342d89bc2789d43a016b13a](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/token/0x524b969793a64a602342d89bc2789d43a016b13a) clicking in the MM icon or do it manually.

I hope this solves your doubts and whatever doubt feel free to ask here in the Daily. Remember that creating a post costs 250 DONUTs that will be removed in your next distribution.

However, I can tell that I can't trust the same way a project that has in the ""power"" people that would insider trading in the first chance and this starts to smell like that. Still waiting him to pop up and try to explain.

I imagine that even thought there is not specific rules against inside trading in the sub, things must be done to avoid the same people gaming the whole market again. I was banned 3 days for tip spam/gaming the tip reward system so I imaging that inside trading falls into a higher category.

2023-10-20 16:18:30,Comment,2,"Honestly, I think this will fall in an empty black hole. I remember the FUD against Internet too. Basically the same FUD that we are seeing now with crypto."

2023-10-20 13:01:21,Comment,1,I will buy it when it is cheaper but it is in my list.
2023-10-20 13:00:57,Comment,1,Now I am back hahaha time to move on from dark times.
2023-10-20 12:51:03,Comment,1,Thanks for your kind words Nano! It has been a big hit but nothing can take me down.
2023-10-20 12:49:33,Comment,2,Now I will create a Web3.0 Reddit copy to hurt Reddit.
2023-10-20 12:05:42,Comment,1,As long as there is volume they will keep taking those tasty fees.
2023-10-20 12:05:09,Comment,1,TLDR; Reddit closed MOONs and BRICKs project.
2023-10-20 12:03:22,Comment,1,Thanks a lot! Time to move on and find a new roadmap. I think I will keep engaging here and maybe even in r/cc but I need time to process everything too.
2023-10-20 12:02:00,Comment,3,"Thank you very much for your kind words.

Yes, the ban came in the perfect time hahaha"

2023-10-20 11:56:26,Comment,3,"Well, here I got some accusations too but I am fine. I am used to it since the day I got on top a long time ago.

Karma will balance thing in the end."
2023-10-20 11:55:22,Comment,1,"I think nothing will happen in sand land but it will be used to dump the market, again."
2023-10-20 11:52:02,Comment,2,Funny. I just made a comment explaining why I think this will not last xD
2023-10-20 11:50:23,Comment,4,"Be aware of the current global situation when FOMOing into this last pump provoked by SEC droping the case to XRP.

I honestly still believe that we will have a double dip recession (second dip) in the following months before the BTC halving. I think this pump will not last.

Reasons:

* Middle East drama used to create panic (US already sent an email to foreign citizens to be more cautious)
* FED pivoting (historic dump)
* Whatever new drama happens in crypto

What do you think?

2023-10-20 11:47:20,Comment,2,"I am waiting for CDC to dump 1.5M MOONs. I think they are the weakest exchange in the equation.

Now that I can't make more money with MOONs,wen DONUTs $10?"
2023-10-20 11:46:25,Comment,2,"Layer 2 is so easy to understand. It is basically putting transaction contracts in a box and then moving the box instead of moving each transaction contract every time you get one.

Energy Efficiency 101."
2023-10-20 11:44:38,Comment,5,If I am not wrong PLUNGER and TACO are too right?
2023-10-20 11:43:01,Comment,6,">TNG, said that he just sold to take care of his wife on maternity leave, which makes sense.

It is funny because that argument is valid but at the same time is like bro, everybody has shit to take care off."
2023-10-20 11:36:18,Comment,1,One way or another it is a gamble. I am fine to putting some cash on it depending how they decide or things happen. Anyway I expect CDC to dump 1.5M MOONs soon.
2023-10-20 11:35:12,Comment,4,I can only say that MOON is LUNA in Spanish. LUNA 2.0 = MOON 2.0? Coincidence. Life is hilarious!
2023-10-20 11:20:19,Comment,1,Reddit fired us xD
2023-10-20 11:19:21,Comment,2,"Exactly this, you need to learn how to interact with communities before doing it properly."
2023-10-20 10:59:14,Comment,4,LUNA 2.0 small bag holder here ahahahah
2023-10-20 10:57:12,Comment,2,I wouldnt blame mods. I think reddit admins sold them to the community. Reddit should have just threated all the people like investors. Not special threatments.
2023-10-20 10:55:24,Comment,2,I think that making publick how much is the limit could help but I think it is better to remove the tipping reward stash.
2023-10-20 10:52:19,Comment,2,Honestly SEC should go after Reddit admins for providing insider info to mods and sell them to the people.
2023-10-20 10:39:02,Comment,2,We will laugh when Reddit shares tank
2023-10-20 10:38:21,Comment,2,"I will keep tipping but with other ""rules"" that I will follow to decide what I tip.

I am happy to be back too :)"
2023-10-20 10:36:59,Comment,3,I won't. I will just try to achieve them with other ways! Thanks!
