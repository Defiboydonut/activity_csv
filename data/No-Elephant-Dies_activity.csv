2023-10-27 12:00:45,Comment,2,I think it's the same thing as last week. Scalpers at work.
2023-10-27 11:56:38,Comment,2,"When all else fails, blame the ~~cow~~ intern"
2023-10-26 20:56:43,Comment,2,"So we dont need the ""becoming intern"" step? :)"
2023-10-26 20:40:27,Comment,2,"I think they don't care.  
I hope it bites them."
2023-10-26 20:39:19,Comment,2,"I also got a bit confused by the constant ""comment contains..."" It's making reading comments rather tiresome but I'd rather get used to it than migrate"
2023-10-26 20:36:04,Comment,5,Me: *(googling)* how to crash an IPO...
2023-10-26 20:26:14,Comment,1,Looks like it's not just the boomer politicos who don't understand/appreciate the blockchain as a very transparent ledger.
2023-10-25 17:24:00,Comment,3,For now we have to put up with Kiwi Browser when we could have just had native experience.

2023-10-25 07:53:01,Comment,1,Oh alright. I'll rest now
2023-10-25 07:22:00,Comment,2,"Something's bugging me... if reddit gets rid of the vault, where are people going to store their RCAs? And how are they going to onboard more noobs if the process will now have to involve creating and linking your own wallet *(instead of the convenient vault)*? These guys are masters at foot-shooting themselves"
2023-10-25 04:43:43,Comment,7,"Still new to donuts... do we have a csv file and maybe a donut week over here? *(Yeah, I'm a refugee from you-know-where)*  
Edit: Thanks, Bronuts"
2023-10-25 04:41:32,Comment,2,My thoughts too. If only they had avoided panicking the market moons would have still had a higher value. But at least *now* we know where the bottom is.
2023-10-24 12:05:10,Comment,3,How can I bridge nova eth to gnosis? Thanks

2023-10-23 10:48:41,Comment,2,Thank you
2023-10-23 09:32:13,Comment,2,Wow! The accuracy of this is lit
2023-10-23 09:30:52,Comment,2,They usually begin on snapshot day then a one-week negativity spree. Screw these bots
2023-10-23 08:37:05,Comment,1,I also dream of donuts on nova. Super smooth chain
2023-10-23 08:35:15,Comment,2,"The moon curse hath descendeth upon us.  
Seriously though, it is terrible behaviour and I feel sad seeing Bronuts getting surprised by it. People here have always been so good. I had gotten used to the trend while at cc and even avoided posting during some hours to avoid the downdoot bots. Sorry guys, but until moons get fixed, *(or the reddit admins get the balls to ban accounts that downvote en masse)* we might continue having that problem"
2023-10-22 19:19:25,Comment,1,*ahem* Cannacoin *ahem*
2023-10-22 09:59:28,Comment,2,">I also in my opinion find that very fishy!  
  
Me too. I figure Reddit probably wanted to kill the whole thing through a very effective weapon: sowing distrust. Rn it seems very difficult to rebuild because of that."
2023-10-21 15:00:13,Comment,1,With on-chain tracking info? I'm in!
2023-10-21 14:57:35,Comment,2,My take about funding the transfers... I think it will go the donut way: PYOG *(pay your own gas)*
2023-10-21 14:48:41,Comment,1,That was quick. Thank you.

2023-10-21 13:10:55,Comment,3,How about we do what we do best? Track the fella's wallets down and find that weak link... a doxxed CEX wallet ;)
