2023-10-28 07:49:26,Comment,3,"100% agree, if their signals and TA actually worked as well as they say, they wouldn't even need to do YouTube. They'd be extremely rich off their investments alone"
2023-10-28 07:01:38,Comment,2,"Used to check the charts too every morning, but I've stopped and my mental health got much better"
2023-10-28 06:16:03,Comment,4,I think $0.35 to $0.50 would be reasonable
2023-10-28 05:43:55,Comment,2,Thanks for the reminder! Almost forgot this time
2023-10-28 05:36:31,Comment,1,"Probably $0.25 to $0.5, but I'm not sure yet"
2023-10-28 05:35:50,Comment,2,Maybe some hype will come back when the distribution happens
2023-10-28 04:50:33,Comment,2,"Yeah, they announced it in the sunsetting Q&A iirc"
2023-10-28 04:23:45,Comment,2,"I agree, plus the gold requirement is unbelievably restrictive"
2023-10-28 03:52:25,Comment,1,Doesn't Reddit not show you the actual upvote count? They just show you an estimate that can go up and down
2023-10-28 03:50:47,Comment,6,"Yeah, it will drag the reputation of RCPs back up, which will be good for donuts too"
2023-10-28 03:11:07,Comment,1,"I disagree, the things he's doing affect crypto more because he's a famous public figure. We should pay attention regardless"
2023-10-27 15:50:33,Comment,2,"I only check once or twice a week, I get important news about price movements here first"
2023-10-27 15:29:11,Comment,1,"Not just you, it dropped significantly since the hype from r/cc died"
2023-10-27 15:16:51,Comment,2,That's why we should work to diversify and not put all our eggs in one Reddit basket
2023-10-27 14:32:01,Comment,2,"200,000 for me, how I wish"
2023-10-27 14:29:26,Comment,1,"I'd rather have all of it locked in profit TBH, it's probably not the best in terms of money, but the peace of mind is so valuable"
2023-10-27 10:52:06,Comment,2,Honestly don't mind TA posts as long as they're instructive and in-depth. That's probably only 1% of them though
2023-10-27 10:49:49,Comment,3,"I'm not counting on a Reddit Admin CSV now, given the lack of communication about it"
2023-10-27 05:13:17,Comment,2,90% ETH and 10% a choice of alts
2023-10-27 02:57:41,Comment,3,"Same, this is all so confusing so I think I'll just wait for the official announcement"
2023-10-27 02:24:20,Comment,3,The good old days of just last week lol
2023-10-27 02:23:08,Comment,1,"Yeah, people are convinced it's bullshit because they expect it to predict the price exactly, which is just unrealistic"
2023-10-27 01:41:22,Comment,3,where does 1.6 and 2.11 come from?
2023-10-26 23:36:43,Comment,1,Guess that means we're still a relatively small community
2023-10-26 23:33:16,Comment,2,It seems to be up for me
2023-10-26 16:07:26,Comment,1,For me it's 100 at Dunkin
2023-10-26 12:26:50,Comment,2,"Looks like you got 3,029 karma"
2023-10-26 12:25:17,Comment,3,Hopefully that was in 2011 or something
2023-10-26 12:01:06,Comment,2,"I haven't fallen for that in years, well played"
2023-10-26 11:51:18,Comment,8,"I'm ranked 225 with 225 karma, how neat"
2023-10-26 08:20:44,Comment,5,Is the mydonuts online site down now?
2023-10-26 05:27:45,Comment,4,"Yeah, I refresh and see the same comments"
2023-10-26 05:11:34,Comment,4,Can the automod be set up to do that automatically?
2023-10-26 05:01:52,Comment,4,"Plus they have upvote bots, which I also saw in r/cc and other crypto subs"
2023-10-26 04:35:25,Comment,2,"I believe they will get to make Moon V2, but without the trust of the community it won't reach the same highs IMO"
2023-10-26 04:24:12,Comment,2,Honestly MOON
2023-10-26 01:55:54,Comment,1,"Yeah, the hype in this sub has died down so much since last week"
2023-10-26 01:09:36,Comment,8,Any updates on what the sub will do instead?
2023-10-26 00:30:58,Comment,3,Good morning!
2023-10-25 15:46:45,Comment,1,Any specific timeframe in mind?
2023-10-25 15:41:31,Comment,1,"Yeah, they swap millions worth of crypto between each other just for the tiniest profit"
2023-10-25 14:37:37,Comment,1,"I don't think so, it's way more flexible than BTC, so I imagine it can have more real-world use cases"
2023-10-25 14:22:59,Comment,2,What's the reason for this big purchase?
2023-10-25 13:42:00,Comment,6,"Yeah, the difference is night and day between here and cc"
2023-10-25 13:38:54,Comment,3,"Personally I haven't seen that yet, although I'm primarily active in the daily"
2023-10-25 12:52:49,Comment,2,"I'm happy with any donuts for the first round, I just want to know how they work for now"
2023-10-25 12:19:52,Comment,3,This sub would have 100k comments in the daily if that happens
2023-10-25 10:50:16,Comment,1,"Maybe they just really needed the money right now, nothing wrong with that"
2023-10-25 10:48:26,Comment,4,Probably speculation as usual with low-cap coins
2023-10-25 10:35:33,Comment,2,"Yeah, the hype from the moon crash died off quicker than I thought"
2023-10-25 09:39:55,Comment,2,"They did say that they were gonna expand that to other countries by early next year, but no updates so far"
2023-10-25 05:04:10,Comment,2,"Yeah, it could take years of good management by the mods, if ever"
2023-10-25 04:32:55,Comment,3,"Hopefully moons 2.0 will go well, at least if the mods who dumped aren't gonna be involved anymore. I'll still be very cautious though"
2023-10-25 04:24:16,Comment,2,"Yeah, slow and steady wins the race after all"
2023-10-25 03:25:58,Comment,2,"Pretty sure it's different even between users, Reddit has been playing with algorithms just like other social media websites"
2023-10-25 03:22:29,Comment,2,Good bot
2023-10-25 03:20:06,Comment,3,!mykarma
2023-10-24 15:18:01,Comment,2,Even limiting it to moderate and above would probably solve the problem without excluding too many people
2023-10-24 14:00:11,Comment,2,"I do wanna see an analysis of donut price vs daily comment counts, that would be interesting"
2023-10-24 09:59:37,Comment,2,I've heard mydonuts.online is good
2023-10-24 08:48:12,Comment,2,Just make a post in the sub and save all of us
2023-10-24 08:07:18,Comment,1,In the coming year? That's a bold prediction
2023-10-24 07:37:15,Comment,2,Does that work for checking monthly karma as well?
2023-10-24 06:07:00,Comment,2,"TBH I'm cautious because I feel like it will drop right away, but at this point who knows"
2023-10-23 16:08:51,Comment,3,ETH
2023-10-23 15:56:08,Comment,2,"I can't believe ELON has that high of a market cap, I thought we learned our lessons in crypto"
2023-10-23 15:36:22,Comment,2,"Not gonna comment on if the reason is bullshit or not, but I personally think the amount of time they took to respond is reasonable, especially with the weight of the allegations. A lot of discussion happened behind the scenes I'm sure"
2023-10-23 14:32:55,Comment,2,"Yeah, I'm considering buying some more because the project looks good. I only have a few dollars worth right now"
2023-10-23 14:30:47,Comment,2,"That kind of warning should be built into all browsers, good that Brave caught that"
2023-10-23 11:04:33,Comment,1,"Only a few subs are using the CQS system right now, so it's probably not that bad yet"
2023-10-23 10:39:39,Comment,3,Selling would probably drop it just as abruptly though
2023-10-23 09:34:55,Comment,4,"I'm still amazed at how different it is here vs r/cc, there's basically no mass-downvoted comments"
2023-10-23 09:16:30,Comment,4,"I think many people from cc gave up on crypto altogether, at least for now"
2023-10-23 09:12:42,Comment,1,ETH is basically 99% of my portfolio right now
2023-10-23 09:12:07,Comment,3,They probably won't have their wallets set up to receive Donuts though
2023-10-23 01:48:53,Comment,5,"Same, my portfolio is all ETH except for some MATIC I got from selling an avatar"
2023-10-23 01:16:49,Comment,3,"If ETH is the main crypto making an impact in the bullrun, we might even see $2T then"
2023-10-22 17:09:57,Comment,4,"If subs would apply to join the program, I'd want it to be because that sub's members want it and not just the mods. Maybe through a public vote"
2023-10-22 15:29:31,Comment,1,"After the Luna disaster, I wouldn't trust in algorithmic stablecoins for a long time TBH"
2023-10-22 15:26:57,Comment,3,!mykarma
2023-10-22 15:25:36,Comment,3,Donuts at $0.23 would be crazy
2023-10-22 14:30:53,Comment,2,Could it be a timezone thing too?
2023-10-22 14:22:25,Comment,3,"Same, at least I get to be here in between classes"
2023-10-22 13:45:34,Comment,2,Definitely ETH
2023-10-22 12:23:10,Comment,2,"If it exists, there's probably an NFT of it already"
2023-10-22 11:39:32,Comment,2,"Yeah, personally I believe it'll fail because it will lack community trust at that point. However, I hope that the good mods figure something out"
2023-10-22 11:34:20,Comment,2,Is it over for Moons 2.0 as well then?
2023-10-22 08:56:28,Comment,2,Probably to increase the figures for Reddit chat lol
2023-10-22 08:25:32,Comment,3,I see BTC and ETH hitting those prices if the ETFs actually happen
2023-10-22 07:59:01,Comment,1,Chocolate with sprinkles
2023-10-22 05:42:31,Comment,3,Wasn't there a popular moon maxi in that sub?
2023-10-22 03:21:03,Comment,3,"And that barely even works, you'd need to downvote thousands of comments to get an extra moon"
2023-10-22 03:14:12,Comment,2,"Yeah, you can see that risk by just changing the timeframe to the last 2 years where the price dropped by half"
2023-10-22 03:01:05,Comment,1,They're gonna make a Netflix series about us in a few years
2023-10-21 15:39:20,Comment,1,"I would have sold, but after the announcement to give others a fair chance"
2023-10-21 15:25:58,Comment,3,"They probably didn't consider the consequences of the announcement, knowing how incompetent Reddit was with stuff like the RCAs"
2023-10-21 14:55:18,Comment,2,"If there's a lot of trading volume over a long time, it adds up"
2023-10-21 14:51:12,Comment,1,Don't you just earn less money compared to when you don't provide liquidity?
2023-10-21 14:29:31,Comment,2,"50% salary is crazy high for me, hope it goes well for you"
2023-10-21 14:24:13,Comment,3,"Most did not, it was only two mods that sold before the official announcement IIRC"
2023-10-21 13:49:41,Comment,1,Imagine your first real trade and you instantly get liquidated
2023-10-21 13:47:16,Comment,1,"Honestly would want BTC at $50k more, because it'll probably mean more interest in crypto as a whole"
2023-10-21 11:52:57,Comment,2,"Interesting, why do you think so?"
2023-10-21 10:06:12,Comment,3," Discord sounds like a great idea to have a closer community, plus it's relatively easy to manage if we use existing bots"
2023-10-21 09:42:09,Comment,8,The endless hopium in the sub didn't help us keep realistic expectations too
2023-10-21 08:17:48,Comment,1,I managed to qualify for the ARB airdrop without even knowing about it
2023-10-21 07:53:29,Comment,3,I thought I could escape the r/cc drama by going here. Guess I was wrong
2023-10-21 07:47:39,Comment,1,"Definitely the death of BTC, it's still the biggest and has the most name recognition. If BTC falls people would lose trust in any other crypto for a long time"
2023-10-21 07:19:34,Comment,3,I'm believing fully in ETH for the future
2023-10-21 07:16:25,Comment,1,"Definitely not, and I didn't say so. I don't see how this is relevant because profit isn't the only deciding factor for those 11"
2023-10-21 06:25:48,Comment,6,"A few mods in r/cc didn't sell until after the announcement or didn't sell at all, so I doubt it when you say that that's what any of us would do"
2023-10-21 05:27:55,Comment,2,"I myself panic swapped my moons straight to ETH during the dump, but I am tempted to buy some donuts now"
2023-10-21 05:26:41,Comment,1,"Yeah, I recommend seeing it for yourself, that thread is just sad now"
2023-10-21 05:24:29,Comment,1,Funnily enough half of the comments there are still talking about MOON
2023-10-21 05:14:46,Comment,6,"I still find it incredible how far r/cc has fallen, even their daily only has 300 comments now"
2023-10-21 05:07:35,Comment,1,"This is why it's so important to be cautious, the crypto user is usually the weakest link"
2023-10-21 04:56:32,Comment,1,"If you lose, your entire wallet gets drained"
2023-10-20 17:08:22,Comment,7,That's why they were so enthusiastic about passing proposals too
2023-10-20 16:05:34,Comment,2,"I saw this was one of the main problems of r/cc, is it that bad here too?"
2023-10-20 15:59:59,Comment,2,"I keep getting added to scam lists and groups on Twitter too, it's so annoying"
2023-10-20 15:52:26,Comment,2,10 million
2023-10-20 15:13:45,Comment,2,The initial hype probably faded a bit
2023-10-20 14:58:41,Comment,3,He could probably buy a million donuts easily if he wanted to anyway
2023-10-20 14:33:46,Comment,2,IIRC it was just a glitch on Apple's part
2023-10-20 13:35:52,Comment,2,I'm pretty much 100% invested in ETH
2023-10-20 13:27:33,Comment,5,"Surprised that there are only less than 5k, this daily feels so active"
2023-10-20 13:14:45,Comment,3,"I guess I am registered then, thanks for your help!"
2023-10-20 13:08:38,Comment,3,How do you know if you're registered by the way? I wanna know if I did it right
2023-10-20 13:04:26,Comment,2,I did my part!
2023-10-20 12:26:39,Comment,1,One of my dreams is to have enough ETH to stake without having to use Rocket Pool or something similar
2023-10-20 12:25:05,Comment,1,"Yeah, and crypto still has a bad reputation among the majority of Reddit users anyway"
2023-10-20 12:13:14,Comment,3,"ETH, I feel like ETH has more flexibility than BTC and so will have more real-world uses"
2023-10-20 11:22:08,Comment,1,Wouldn't the price go higher because there are more people on the sub now?
2023-10-20 10:58:14,Comment,2,"Same, I'm just holding ETH long-term because my experience with trading alts has not been that good"
2023-10-20 10:37:23,Comment,2,"Yeah, the crypto market has been going up slow and steady over the past year"
2023-10-20 09:56:53,Comment,3,The price of Moons is lower than Bricks at this point
2023-10-20 09:55:16,Comment,1,Was it proven to be from cointelegraph yet?
2023-10-20 09:01:16,Comment,5,"Yeah, as much as I try to interact there, there's just way less comments to reply to"
2023-10-19 23:17:11,Comment,3,"It doesn't help that the mods have increased MOON distributions, some of them had $100k worth or more"
2023-10-19 16:29:09,Comment,1,It's nice how there are still a lot of comedy posts despite the ratio
2023-10-19 15:46:53,Comment,2,"Me, I'm still trying to figure out how donuts work. This is a new world for me"
2023-10-19 11:35:04,Comment,2,They still say both lines now and it just sounds contradictory
2023-10-19 10:13:07,Comment,0,"Agree 100%, I'm pleasantly surprised that you welcomed us from r/cc as much as you did"
2023-10-19 07:56:11,Comment,2,"Yeah, even some of the mods cashed everything out and quit entirely"
2023-10-19 07:49:36,Comment,3,"And r/cc posts don't even get 10 comments in an hour now, it feels like a ghost town in comparison"
2023-10-19 07:35:59,Comment,1,I hope we learn our lesson and don't let that happen here
2023-10-19 04:55:29,Comment,5,"Pretty standard behavior for a reddit mod these days, I'm not surprised"
2023-10-19 04:53:23,Comment,0,"Yeah, the supply was basically only 25% until the moment Reddit support got dropped"
2023-10-19 04:51:46,Comment,5,"Same, r/cc has gotten so negative and I didn't even realize"
2023-10-18 16:40:39,Comment,2,Is the leaderboard available on an external website?
2023-10-18 16:01:43,Comment,2,"Yeah, the fact that donuts were ""unofficial"" actually swayed me toward MOON a year ago, but I was wrong"
2023-10-18 15:13:48,Comment,2,"Touche, I've only ever heard good things from here"
2023-10-18 15:07:17,Comment,5,"Finally ended up here after the moons collapse, maybe donuts are fun too"
