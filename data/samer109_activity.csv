2023-10-27 07:40:59,Comment,">Relying on Reddit or Going Independent: One option is to rely less on Reddit's karma points and shift our focus to an independent system. For instance, we could convert Posts and Comments Donuts into Bonus Donuts earned through receiving tips. This way, we maintain a form of community-driven reward system, ensuring that quality posts are still rewarded.

So not relying on upvotes? Can you elaborate more on this?",1
