2023-10-25 17:11:23,Comment,2,"This is also quite interresting:

>*Cryptocurrencies are among your assets in box 3. You declare the economic value of your cryptocurrency on January 1 (reference date). You use the rate on the reference date of the exchange platform used.*

So as long as I keep me and my partner's savings under ‚Ç¨114.000, we don't pay taxes on savings and also not from crypto. Means we have to spend it if we reach it. What most people do is buy gold, because it's not registered.

Also, only the 1st of January is important.. If you go above the ‚Ç¨114.000 you just spend it in December on gold or a Rolex (which are unregistered assets) and sell it later on. AND they only check assets on a CEX, so many 'tricks' can be executed here which I will not promote, but you get the idea..

>*Mining requires a lot of computer capacity. The associated costs will often be so high that there will be little benefit. Another factor that plays a role is that you can only mine a limited amount of cryptocurrency per day. That is why you do not have to declare the proceeds from mining yourself.*

This is a pretty awesome rule as wel.. How can I/they prove if I mined my assets. And what if I mined BTC for example and trade that for other assets?! Does that still count as revenue from mining?! Nobody can tell me..

2023-10-25 16:54:25,Comment,2,"Yes, different sources of income are put in 'boxes'. Each with different rules and tax scales.

Box 1: Wages, tips or profits from business; benefit, pension, annuity and alimony; foreign income; income as a freelancer, childminder, artist or professional athlete.

Box 2: In box 2 you pay tax on your income from a substantial interest. Do you own at least 5% of the shares, options or profit-sharing certificates of a company? Or do you have this together with a tax partner? Then you have income from a substantial interest.

Box 3: Assets are the value of all assets (such as savings and shares) minus debts. You do not pay tax on part of it. This is the tax-free allowance. The assets on which you do not have to pay tax will be ‚Ç¨57,000 in 2023 (was ‚Ç¨50,650).

|Year|Year Tax-free capital without partner|Tax-free capital with partner|

It seems like he made an honest mistake by assuming the information was public. Mistakes happen, and it's good that he clarified and sought confirmation afterward.

The argument that he asked about public knowledge *afterwards* doesn't necessarily justify his action.

Timing is crucial, and one or more transactions just minutes before the official announcement raise questions about whether he had an awareness of the non-public nature of the information.

2023-10-23 07:04:56,Comment,2,"Firstmate's first reaction:

>*At first glance, there are some nuances that may make it particularly difficult to support trading Reddit Collectible Avatars in $donut. While Reddit Collectible Avatars and $CONE are on Polygon, which makes our support straightforward, RCAs and $donut are seemingly on two different chains. But, we'll need to take a look at the smart contract to understand how it's implemented.*

This is the response I got from them after they discussed it internally:

>*Thanks for your patience as we took a closer look - unfortunately this confirmed our suspicions that a marketplace supporting the sale of RCA's in $donut is not currently feasible, because the erc-20 is on a different chain (Eth) than the RCA's (Polygon). If the erc-20 was on Polygon, this would be relatively straightforward for us to implement.*"

I reached out to the Rabby-team on their Discord for clarification after I found an iOS version in Apple's official App Store.

**This is their official response:**

&#x200B;

If there's a fake app circulating then it's possible that when you insert your seed phrase will be sent or captured."
2023-10-16 09:47:06,Comment,8,"I often hear people talk about Rabby Wallet, but something still doesn't sit right with me.

According to their [official website](https://rabby.io/) they don't have iOS/Android version. There is also no beta or anything. It literally says *""Stay tuned""*

However, in the iOS App Store I can find an app called *""Rabby - DeFi""* from the publisher *""Rabby Jamfield Engineering Services"".* Using the same logo/icons.

This makes me uncomfortable, and it's something I don't really trust.

Is their website not up to date, or is it possible a fake app using the same name entered the app store (by bad actors)?"
