2023-10-27 10:49:23,Comment,1,"Well, the merge was not supposed to skyrocket ETH. Also, it happened in 2022, the bearest of years. And spot ETF would actually bring money into the ecosystem."
2023-10-27 10:09:58,Comment,3,FOMO scrambles your thinking. When I bought my first BTC in 2022 I thought I was too late and that the game had been played without me‚Ä¶

2023-10-27 10:05:23,Comment,1,I can‚Äôt imagine how it must have been to join during the 2021 bull and see it all disappear in 6 months‚Ä¶ joining during a bear is much better

2023-10-27 10:04:08,Comment,1,"Crabbing for a long while, unless the ETFs go through, in which case the sky is the limit."

2023-10-27 09:24:47,Comment,2,"Gen Z will definitely get in on the bandwagon (if they haven‚Äôt already). I see a lot of scams popping up on social media. They are savvy enough and many probably already dipped their toes in crypto, but there are many more waiting to get scammed."

2023-10-27 09:21:26,Comment,2,As long as we remember to take profits‚Ä¶
2023-10-27 08:43:04,Comment,3,Small correction. Maintain the course and DCA ahead. We still have time before the bull run
2023-10-27 08:28:23,Comment,2,I know. But it still gives me the data from the last round. Maybe in between rounds it gets a bit confused‚Ä¶
2023-10-27 08:23:46,Comment,2,"There might be something wrong with the estimate on mydonuts.online. My last update says more than 500k donuts!

2023-10-27 08:14:57,Comment,4,Commenting away
2023-10-27 08:14:47,Comment,2,Exactly. Zoom out and get some perspective. Keep your DCA strategy and you will see it pay off before long.
2023-10-27 05:21:39,Comment,2,"I have a question: on mydonuts.online my estimate on the last day was around 13k donuts. According to this CSV file, it‚Äôs around 600. What is the huge difference due to?"

2023-10-26 08:58:04,Comment,1,Me too. I‚Äôve been DCAing all through 2022 and it‚Äôs been tough. But maybe finally soon it will be time to reap the rewards.

2023-10-26 07:35:41,Comment,1,Same here. Every time it hear or read anything on a topic I know I realize that probably I should trust very little and inform myself a lot better on everything else.

2023-10-24 13:32:49,Comment,1,That‚Äôs a big swing. Do you know when was the last time the index stood at 67%?
2023-10-24 13:32:19,Comment,6,"Yesterday saw $400m in crypto liquidations‚Ä¶ when will people learn?

2023-10-24 10:25:41,Comment,2,"This. But green is such a nice color after all. That being said, let‚Äôs see if this pump lasts and at what levels. Maybe in 12 months ETH at $2000 will seem incredibly cheap."

2023-10-24 10:22:49,Comment,1,Totally. I keep checking it to make sure it‚Äôs real

2023-10-24 08:39:48,Comment,3,"Interesting. I have a more progressive selling strategy, that is based on my average buy price and I sell a little of it every month, the higher the price the more I sell in proportion.

2023-10-24 07:25:42,Comment,3,My exact same feeling. I checked my balance and for a second I forgot how numbers work

2023-10-23 21:47:16,Comment,1,"Considering the times it is repeated in every conceivable shape and form, I still don‚Äôt get why people don‚Äôt  DCA and chill. Like, why? It‚Äôs the easiest thing in the universe."
2023-10-23 21:44:32,Comment,1,Interesting to see Near up so high. I really hope they will find greater adoption and success.
2023-10-23 21:38:39,Comment,8,Conclusion: BTC and ETH are king.
2023-10-23 21:37:28,Comment,1,Same. Have your strategy in place for both buys and sells and follow it. Sleep happy and let the market do its thing.
2023-10-23 21:36:36,Comment,2,My money‚Äôs on the crab
2023-10-23 21:34:07,Comment,2,"Good. Who can afford these prices anyway?

Also, if the theory that the bull run is every 4 years is correct, we have at least another year of bear‚Äìcrab before us."
2023-10-23 14:23:51,Comment,1,Nope. Buy hopium is hopium
2023-10-23 14:22:41,Comment,1,Well said
2023-10-23 14:21:51,Comment,2,JPMorgan say that most likely it will get approved by January 10th (the deadline for the Ark 21Shares application). Do we believe it?

2023-10-23 14:06:49,Comment,3,"Exactly this. Solid, realistic returns are the only good returns. But most people don‚Äôt have the patience and want 100x in a couple of weeks"
2023-10-23 13:55:04,Comment,1,I‚Äôm not sure any other form of punishment would be possible though. A fine maybe? But how?
2023-10-23 13:54:29,Comment,2,Definitely. The long game is the only game worth playing.
2023-10-23 13:18:57,Comment,1,"True that. I believe that SOL works best in a good mix of coins in a portfolio, with most of it being BTC and ETH, of course"
2023-10-23 13:03:54,Comment,1,"Well, bull runs are crazy and within the next 20 years a lot is possible. Right now, it doesn‚Äôt look particularly good, of course. We‚Äôll see."
2023-10-23 12:57:23,Comment,2,Sept 2021 wow. Pretty amazing for a few weeks and then absolutely wrecking I suppose. Kudos to you for sticking around and growing.
2023-10-23 12:55:55,Comment,2,Every week of every month of every year is the best time to buy ü´°
2023-10-23 12:47:36,Comment,2,BTC has been above $30k for the last 14 hours. I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe at these altitudes‚Ä¶ not used to this anymore‚Ä¶  my head feels so light‚Ä¶what is this? Actual hope instead of the usual hopium?
2023-10-23 12:43:04,Comment,2,I started investing in early 2022 and I feel you so much. Green feels so unusual.
2023-10-23 12:42:23,Comment,1,"If mere rumors push the price so hard, an actual approval is going to be absolutely ballistic!"

2023-10-23 12:03:32,Comment,1,"I believe we are still in the crabbing phase of the bear market. Keep holding and, if you can, keep accumulating. Patience is the key and be prepared for some red before you see more green again."
2023-10-23 11:55:25,Comment,2,I get that. When I started with r/cc I was a stat fanatic and I kept track of every single karma I got there and the ratio and the price and everything. I‚Äôll try to be more chill here now‚Ä¶
2023-10-23 11:54:12,Comment,2,When I stared with r/cc like 50% of comments were people complaining about ALGO‚Ä¶

2023-10-23 11:17:15,Comment,2,Seems the most hated project of 2023. I‚Äôm even surprised it‚Äôs still around and the price still seems to be holding up
2023-10-23 11:16:04,Comment,2,"So true. Crypto was sold to me as fast money, but it has taught me patience more than anything else in my life"
2023-10-23 11:14:55,Comment,1,"SOL, ADA, MATIC, DOT, NEAR. Although, of course, most of my portfolio is BTC and ETH"
2023-10-23 11:13:12,Comment,0,"Honestly Donuts. I already DCA into ETH, while donuts have the chance to go 10x or more during a bull run. ETH doesn‚Äôt."

2023-10-23 11:11:24,Comment,1,Buy the same $ amount twice a month. No matter what happens. And have a pre-decided exit plan.
2023-10-23 11:09:08,Comment,0,Definitely. Insider trading goes against all this community was built and stands for.
2023-10-23 11:08:06,Comment,3,Good!
2023-10-23 10:59:43,Comment,1,"It‚Äôs bound to rebound, but only after the bullrun has started. BTC will lead and ETH will follow"
2023-10-23 10:58:47,Comment,2,"ETH will see massive growth next year, especially after a spot ETF approval. Still bullish on SOL though and I‚Äôll keep DCAing into it. The future looks so bright. We are still in bear market and these are prime times to accumulate."
2023-10-23 10:56:34,Comment,1,"As others have pointed out, it‚Äôs a matter of demand, not only supply. Once the demand surges again, the reduced supply will make itself heard. Until then, we crab."
2023-10-23 08:14:27,Comment,1,"Reddit messing everything up. They will go up again, but it will take time"
2023-10-23 08:13:03,Comment,1,LINK is absolutely raging

2023-10-23 04:56:16,Comment,2,Exactly. That‚Äôs what I did the day moons went down
2023-10-23 04:55:40,Comment,1,I hope the project will really be a beacon for all the people that got rugged by Reddit. Decentralization is king!
2023-10-23 04:46:48,Comment,2,Everyone I open the charts I have a shock
2023-10-23 04:46:24,Comment,2,"But we‚Äôve been good bronuts, we‚Äôve been DCA ing during the bear, and have a solid exit plan. Right?"
2023-10-23 04:45:37,Comment,3,ETH is on a roll and donuts will follow right up!
2023-10-23 04:44:48,Comment,2,Good morning! It‚Äôs still dark outside but the charts are as bright as ever. $1700 here we come!!
2023-10-22 21:03:04,Comment,2,"Polygon has pretty low gas fees too, no? Although maybe not as low as Gnosis.

I hope that more people will read this post and give their opinion."
2023-10-22 20:33:17,Comment,1,"Finding more use cases for donuts is fundamental to the health of the token and the benefits to the community. I feel that Gnosis kind of closes us the possibilities a bit. I know nothing, so I‚Äôm not sure if we could have donuts on polygon as well. Beyond that, any marketplace that would accept donuts is of course a good thing and having something like Firstmate being interested is great."

2023-10-22 18:59:07,Comment,1,Nice. Looking forward to that.
2023-10-22 18:58:37,Comment,2,It‚Äôs getting closer and closer for sure. And the ETH ones will follow right after

2023-10-22 18:02:07,Comment,2,I know most people say that it was a bad move and should have waited (of course) but maybe they needed the money now and this was the only option. Investments don‚Äôt always go as planned and sometimes tough decisions are necessary.
2023-10-22 17:54:10,Comment,1,Imagine buying at sub $1500 and making 2x

2023-10-22 13:31:34,Comment,2,We all hope so. 2025 cannot come fast enough.
2023-10-22 13:30:46,Comment,1,"Once again, decentralization is king. I open that more communities will realize that and, if it suits them, move toward a decentralized mode like donuts."
2023-10-22 13:29:21,Comment,2,"I hope so too. But the community needs to win back trust, and that won‚Äôt be easy."
2023-10-22 13:27:15,Comment,1,Can we please have non Elon-powered pumps? That would be great.
2023-10-22 08:34:51,Comment,3,I wish there was one tbh. But I‚Äôd like to hear what other people‚Äôs experience is.
2023-10-22 08:33:46,Comment,1,No wonder that there are no comments on this post‚Ä¶ üßê
2023-10-22 07:38:49,Comment,1,I hope so. The more the better!
2023-10-22 07:29:03,Comment,1,"Sorry, but Marc Andreessen is a VC billionaire with his head stuck far up his own ass. He sees philanthropy as rich people keeping their money and if anything getting richer because they have done enough for the world."
2023-10-22 07:27:11,Comment,2,"I love it here on EthTrader, but while the daily is definitely better than on r/cc, the other posts receive relatively little attention, and from always the same users. I wish there was more engagement on a wider scale."

2023-10-22 07:10:35,Comment,2,I think that already realized it. But probably won‚Äôt stick around too long

2023-10-22 05:18:08,Comment,3,Good morning and congratulations to all LINK holders!
2023-10-21 18:46:08,Comment,1,"Maybe. It depends on where the community will be by then, how many members, how much activity, market cap, utility, so on."
2023-10-21 18:37:42,Comment,2,"Maybe, but not anytime soon."
2023-10-21 18:37:12,Comment,2,"I hope that, if and when Reddit messes up for good, this community will have an exit plan."
2023-10-21 18:36:30,Comment,2,"Definitely. And have a good, progressive exit plan, one that will allow you to take real profits no matter how high or not the market goes or for how long."

2023-10-21 14:58:32,Comment,1,Me too. And between here and r/cc I chose to be active on r/cc. Such a rookie mistake‚Ä¶
2023-10-21 14:57:46,Comment,2,Upvoted! We have to stay positive and wait for all the recent changes to subside

2023-10-20 04:46:31,Comment,1,"Because, when in doubt, blame Gary."
2023-10-20 04:46:05,Comment,1,Definitely. Part of me still can‚Äôt believe it.
2023-10-20 04:44:48,Comment,1,I did think it was the first one at the beginning. At least I know better now
2023-10-20 04:44:06,Comment,1,"The irony is the fact that the main role of the SEC is to protect investors‚Ä¶

Like, thank you so much Gary, I feel so f*cking protected right now!"
2023-10-20 04:35:25,Comment,1,"That‚Äôs why I plan to slowly DCA out. At least you get some profits, so matter what happens. If it keeps going up: more profits. If it goes down: some profits, and then I start buying again."
2023-10-19 19:33:03,Comment,1,"Definitely. That‚Äôs why I want to have a strategy in place, in order to take greediness out of the equation and take profits."
2023-10-19 19:10:33,Comment,2,This is exactly the hopium I need to go to bed in peace. Goodnight bronuts!
2023-10-19 19:01:50,Comment,3,"As probably most people, I have BTC and ETH make up a majority of my portfolio. The rest is a selection of alts from the top 20. The hard part for me is to have an exit strategy. I plan to slowly DCA out, but I yet have to decide my target prices for when to start."
2023-10-19 18:36:48,Comment,2,I really hope they will do well in the next 2 years. We might have donut millionaires!
2023-10-19 18:12:15,Comment,1,"Partially guilty as charged: I was already mildly active in this sub, but the whole rugpull thing made me fully jump ship"
2023-10-19 18:11:15,Comment,2,"We already had it in Austria for a while. Never used it though, but I can definitely imagine the grandmas sending their  grandchildren cookies for Christmas using NFT stamps. Granny‚Äôs a degen."
2023-10-19 18:09:38,Comment,1,I did 70. Sorry.
2023-10-19 17:22:02,Comment,2,"Yeah, I was wondering too why Gnosis, as it‚Äôs not such a well known and implemented chain."
2023-10-19 17:18:03,Comment,2,It will be both. A corporate money maker and the chance to truly own your money and assets.
2023-10-19 17:14:17,Comment,1,Even before if I reach my goals! I‚Äôll slowly DCA out.
2023-10-19 17:13:27,Comment,1,I‚Äôll be on my bestest behavior üòá
2023-10-19 17:02:42,Comment,2,So looking forward to 2025
2023-10-19 16:38:11,Comment,2,"Makes me think of how many times Bitcoin has been declared ‚Äòdead‚Äô by the press. All the supposed FUD turned into a long term experiment with a whole future in front of it, an experiment that‚Äôs showing other communities what‚Äôs possible with community points. I‚Äôm as bullish as ever (and I hope that r/cc gets its shit together, because the more of this there is, the better)."
2023-10-19 13:35:42,Comment,2,"I‚Äôm not sure a limit would be the best thing. A separate, meta sub would probably address the issue and leave all the space people want to discuss donuts and related."
2023-10-19 13:32:28,Comment,2,"Me neither actually, but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs seeing so much activity"
2023-10-19 13:13:17,Comment,2,I‚Äôll take it back then and wait for the night for my greetings.
2023-10-19 13:10:07,Comment,5,"There is already a post up complaining about donut farming from former r/cc users. Is this the general feel among long time users of this sub? How do you feel about this new influx? Are you worried that the sub will change too much and for the worse?

Personally, I felt very welcome here. But I also never thought that silly moon farming was particularly bad on r/cc. People got competitive, sure. But I always got the help I needed, had good discussions, and learned a lot."
2023-10-19 13:07:10,Comment,2,I‚Äôm from Europe. What about ‚Äúgood afternoon‚Äù?
2023-10-19 12:52:17,Comment,1,Wrong space bro
2023-10-19 12:52:06,Comment,0,That would start to look like justice. I hope something will be done.
2023-10-19 12:13:05,Comment,2,"Never done accumulating. Yet, to me it‚Äôs more important to have an exit plan for when the bull comes"
2023-10-19 12:12:23,Comment,1,That is true. Only BTC and ETH are looking pretty healthy. Most altcoins got thrashed and are still around those levels
2023-10-19 12:11:28,Comment,1,"Look, JPMorgan learned how crypto cycles work."
2023-10-19 12:09:56,Comment,3,Comedy? This is literally what my whole life hinges on!
2023-10-19 11:40:05,Comment,2,My opinion too. On the long run I hope that donuts‚Äô model will prove the best one
2023-10-19 11:39:05,Comment,2,"Patience makes the good trader, I suppose."
2023-10-19 11:38:43,Comment,1,That‚Äôs the spirit
2023-10-19 11:24:09,Comment,5,The price of donuts has kind of leveled off in the last hours. I hope that the rebound from yesterday‚Äôs low is not already over. What do you think?
2023-10-19 11:06:55,Comment,2,I had been there for 2 months and felt incredibly mad and frustrated
2023-10-19 11:06:14,Comment,1,That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking too
2023-10-19 11:05:38,Comment,2,Thank you!
2023-10-19 09:31:29,Comment,2,It does. Thank you. At least we still have this sub (although I‚Äôm curious to see what‚Äôs gonna happen to r/cc)
2023-10-19 09:27:48,Comment,2,A bit more than 1k. I only had 1 distribution and I was eagerly waiting for my second one‚Ä¶
2023-10-19 09:26:27,Comment,2,"Yet, the price for moons keeps going up. Who‚Äôs buying?"
2023-10-19 09:23:14,Comment,2,They did. I was so mad I dumped all my moons and scooped up some donuts. Never looking back.
2023-10-19 09:22:17,Comment,3,"Yeah, I see this as a long term thing too. Also, with such a small market cap and small liquidity the chances are quite slim I believe."
2023-10-19 09:18:04,Comment,5,"What do you think are the chances of Donuts being listed by a CEX? And, would you actually want that (with all the speculation, pumps & dumps that might come with it) or would you prefer to keep them just as a utility for the sub?"
2023-10-19 09:14:56,Comment,1,"I DCA regularly twice a month. I don‚Äôt have a particular target, but I‚Äôm trying to work out a selling strategy."
2023-10-19 09:12:51,Comment,2,"Mostly I‚Äôm mad because I was so active on r/cc this month and they cancelled the upcoming distribution. But, there‚Äôs no sense in dwelling on the past. Now we are here and it‚Äôs about making the best of it."
2023-10-19 09:11:01,Comment,1,Thank you!
2023-10-19 09:10:45,Comment,1,Try the stakely faucet. The one in the gnosis website seems to be out
2023-10-19 08:37:55,Comment,1,"I try to solve that issue by diversifying a lot in my alts, so that is one drops, no big deal, and if one moons, it‚Äôs a nice gain. Also, only top 20 alts. Crypto is already risky enough as it is."
2023-10-19 08:36:36,Comment,2,"I was in both, but mostly in r/cc because I felt that the engagement there was higher (although not always positive) and I liked the fact they they are a general crypto sub and not focused on Ethereum. Ever since yesterday though, I do feel the better vibes and better users in this sub though. I guess it takes time to adjust and learn."
2023-10-19 08:33:40,Comment,2,"Yeah, I guess that numbers in this sub will change rapidly. Let‚Äôs see if all the new users stick around for the long haul."
2023-10-19 08:32:56,Comment,1,"Yes, I like it here so far. Let‚Äôs have a great journey together. And I really hope Donuts will see more and more adoption, use cases, and success."
2023-10-19 08:30:19,Comment,1,"To me, first mover advantage and L2s. It is safe, stable, and L2s make it fast and scalable. There is competition in the form of other L1s of course, and I hope some of them will succeed in the long term because competition is always beneficial, but Ethereum is king and will remain such."
2023-10-19 08:25:30,Comment,1,"Well, maybe a small share in donuts. But I‚Äôm a safe investor, you know. Large caps first."
2023-10-19 07:47:14,Comment,3,"Yeah, I thought the same and converted my moons to donuts. I was like, these are two elevators that are sitting at the ground floor, but only one of them is going back up."
2023-10-19 07:46:20,Comment,2,"I was skeptic of donuts too to be honest and to me, looking at the value, was a no brained to focus on moons. But, well, I guess I have learned my lesson. Independence and decentralization are fundamental, unless you have insider knowledge. I hope that this community and donuts will thrive and grow for many many years to come."
2023-10-19 07:44:10,Comment,2,"I joined to, but I‚Äôm not sure how to earn those crispy yet juicy tacos"
2023-10-19 07:43:04,Comment,2,Burned donuts smell the best
2023-10-19 07:42:41,Comment,1,"Well, pretty much what I‚Äôm doing now I guess: 40% BTC, 20% ETH, the rest a well thought out basket of alts."
2023-10-19 07:41:13,Comment,1,"Well, the rich more than investing in ‚Äúgold, silver, and Bitcoin‚Äù have stock options and large shares of profitable companies, that benefit from large, cheap amounts of cash floating around in the economy."
2023-10-19 07:12:27,Comment,1,F spez forever
2023-10-19 07:04:57,Comment,1,Long live the bear! This is the best time to accumulate and learn
2023-10-19 07:04:36,Comment,3,Sounds realistic. It depends on whether they manage to keep the contract alive and take it over from Reddit imo
2023-10-19 07:03:54,Comment,1,Hey wonderful bronuts! When is the next snapshot? I‚Äôm still fairly new here and I‚Äôm trying to get my bearings.
2023-10-19 04:57:12,Comment,2,"Thank you so much for the warm welcome and the super-useful guide! These are tough, weird times and it‚Äôs great to find a new, wonderful community after being rugpulled like that. I hope that r/cc will find its footing again and that they will manage to continue with moons. In the meantime, long live the delicious donuts!"
2023-10-19 04:32:00,Comment,1,"Definitely be ready. But also, should they turn the right way, they would propel the bull run to incredible levels. We just have to wait and be ready for anything I guess‚Ä¶"
2023-10-19 04:20:38,Comment,3,"A bit unfamiliar, but delicious nonetheless. The only problem is that my fingers smell like sweet, deep-fried dough after I type a comment. Is that normal?"
2023-10-19 04:19:00,Comment,3,I did the same. Let‚Äôs give to this community and be lifted by it.
2023-10-19 04:18:20,Comment,3,"Hey, I‚Äôm already 1% whale"
2023-10-19 04:17:49,Comment,3,"I saw. It‚Äôs insane. As much as crypto people generally tend to ignore macro factors and only focus on crypto-specific ones (halving, ETFs‚Ä¶), the macro conditions are kind of worrying me and I believe they will be what makes or breaks the next bull run."
2023-10-19 04:16:12,Comment,1,"I converted all my moons to donuts. I figured, they were both down hard, but only one was gonna bounce back. I‚Äôm glad I did."
2023-10-19 04:15:12,Comment,-1,I promise I will only add to the awesomeness with 0% toxicity
2023-10-18 21:18:05,Comment,1,"Bro, how did you know?"
2023-10-18 20:20:02,Comment,1,And almost 100 likes!
2023-10-18 20:19:03,Comment,2,"Well, let‚Äôs say it will be very hard to win back trust and users‚Ä¶"
2023-10-18 20:06:06,Comment,3,"But they technically could adopt the donut model, no?"
2023-10-18 19:59:45,Comment,2,"That, but also, in theirs words ‚Äúwe‚Äôll continue in the spirit of points.‚Äù No idea what that is supposed to mean though‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs probably better not to expect anything much from them."
2023-10-18 19:56:28,Comment,2,"I like the vibes here and I agree with you. When I joined r/cc (only 2 months ago) I also just considered moons a nice bonus. But then after a month on the sub I got the equivalent of $300 in moons and I was like, this is some serious money, not just a nice bonus, and the whole thing became a lot more competitive for me. Not that‚Äôs it‚Äôs good, but getting monthly airdrops that large kind of changes your perspective on things and it‚Äôs hard to keep it ‚Äòcasual‚Äô let‚Äôs say."
2023-10-18 19:48:15,Comment,2,"They want to implement some other form of reward for users. At least, at far as I understood it. This version of RCPs is gone, but they will implement something different in the future. Or am I reading the announcement wrong?"
2023-10-18 19:45:02,Comment,4,"I really hope they will find a solution and keep moons alive somehow. In the meantime, I migrated my moons to donuts and I‚Äôll hang around here for the time being, always keeping an eye on what happens on the other side."
2023-10-18 19:43:26,Comment,2,I like it and I‚Äôm curious (though not particularly optimistic) to see what Reddit decides to do in the future with official community points.
2023-10-18 19:41:43,Comment,1,"I never liked or understood it either. I always upvoted for good content in an honest way and almost never downvoted unless it was absolutely warranted. I‚Äôm glad this sub is a bit different and more friendly, especially to newcomers."
2023-10-18 19:35:17,Comment,2,Thank you!
2023-10-18 19:17:22,Comment,6,"Noob question: is there an easy way to bridge donuts from Gnosis to Mainnet? Also, does it make sense in the first place to bridge them? Where do you keep yours?"
2023-10-18 19:13:00,Comment,2,"Well, I liked r/cc moons because I generally like chaotic things, but this is nice too"
2023-10-18 19:02:39,Comment,3,Yes. You can use a faucet such as stakely
2023-10-18 19:01:23,Comment,2,"No target yet, as I‚Äôm not yet super familiar with the token. But, if the bull run delivers, maybe  around 20x from now?"
2023-10-18 19:00:10,Comment,3,I‚Äôve never felt so welcome in a community before. I‚Äôll grab a donut to fight back the tears‚Ä¶
2023-10-18 18:15:52,Comment,1,The long haul is the only haul (unless you get rugpulled by greedy corporate heads‚Ä¶)

2023-10-18 13:43:54,Comment,3,Is this sub going to become more like r/cc with 3‚Äì4k people online at any given time?
2023-10-18 13:38:41,Comment,2,Definitely. There will be new proposals and new rules. These are times to transition and adjust.

2023-10-18 12:52:48,Comment,2,"At least donuts have the opportunity to slowly gain from this. Moons are just done for, unless mods at r/cc figure out a way to revive them"

2023-10-18 12:41:26,Comment,2,"‚ÄúPart of why we‚Äôre moving past this product is that we‚Äôve already launched, or are actively investing in, several products that accomplish what the Community Points program was trying to accomplish, while being easier to adopt and understand.‚Äù

2023-10-18 12:23:13,Comment,4,I will keep a foot in r/cc and see in which direction they decide to move. I‚Äôve been active in this sub as well and I‚Äôm glad a lot of people are finding a new home here

2023-10-18 06:48:46,Comment,2,"I agree. Yet, I always felt like it was more fun on r/cc. Sure, the shitposting is annoying sometimes, but there‚Äôs always more activity and it‚Äôs easier to get into interesting conversations or get the advice you need."

2023-10-17 13:56:38,Comment,2,"That‚Äôs the plan. As long as he lifts all of us, I‚Äôm fine with it."
2023-10-16 21:17:04,Comment,2,It will be absolutely insane! I just hope I‚Äôll be able to DCA just a bit more before we get there.
2023-10-16 21:05:51,Comment,1,It makes me look forward to the actual ETF approval so much. It‚Äôs gonna be insane. Shorts will get rekt by the billion $. People will sell organs to buy more. And those who have been DCAing for years will just sit back and enjoy.
2023-10-16 21:03:36,Comment,1,‚ÄúPent up interest.‚Äù No shit
2023-10-16 21:02:34,Comment,3,I imagine him being a fake degen on the internet to enjoy the mess he is creating.
2023-10-16 20:59:35,Comment,1,"I‚Äôm glad this happened. I‚Äôm sorry for all those that got rekt, but we saw a tiny sneak peek of what will happen once it actually gets approved. It will be so beautiful and chaotic."
2023-10-16 20:51:59,Comment,2,At least $5000 by the end of the year. Maybe edging towards $8000 but not quite reaching it.
2023-10-16 20:41:47,Comment,2,Just find a job at CoinTelegraph and write that Donuts have been listed on Binance. Job done.
2023-10-16 20:39:45,Comment,3,Always been bullish on Polygon. It will meet as the most solid and adopted L2.
2023-10-16 20:38:49,Comment,1,DCA is the only way. These short term price movements mean little.
2023-10-16 20:36:59,Comment,1,"While the rest of the world works with crypto firms to benefit them and their customers. Sad to see, really."
2023-10-16 20:36:21,Comment,1,There are exiting all the crypto firms. I just feel for anybody in the UK seriously invested in crypto. I hope the legislative environment will change there.
2023-10-16 20:34:55,Comment,1,Donuts down like 9%
2023-10-15 11:10:21,Comment,2,"I‚Äôm very new here, so anything is welcome. Last round I got 48‚Ä¶"
2023-10-15 11:09:01,Comment,1,I‚Äôm not used to this. I might have to lie down and look at the charts to get rid of the dizziness
2023-10-14 13:37:04,Comment,1,Pay back my mortgage üò≠

2023-10-14 13:36:27,Comment,2,"I need more time to accumulate tbh, but when the bull comes, who can say no?"
2023-10-13 20:59:39,Comment,1,A wallet waiting to be filled. Nice.
2023-10-13 11:16:07,Comment,2,What the heck is Steem?
2023-10-12 20:56:33,Comment,1,I trust that more than an AI algorithm
2023-10-12 20:55:48,Comment,1,I don‚Äôt know the price of Axie could drop any lower‚Ä¶
2023-10-12 20:54:32,Comment,2,"There‚Äôs little I don‚Äôt mind of my own exchange. There‚Äôs a 1‚Äì2% spread on swaps (which is not too bad, imo) and in general it works as it‚Äôs supposed to. And I get good customer service in case there‚Äôs any issue. The thing I don‚Äôt like is the limited choice of coins and chains, so that sometimes you have to bridge assets because the exchange does not support a particular chain. In this, DEXs are more flexible."
2023-10-12 19:34:03,Comment,1,"To me, it‚Äôs still the only crypto game that‚Äôs actually fun and free 2 play. I‚Äôm glad they keep releasing updates and seem to have a decent base of players."
2023-10-12 19:32:39,Comment,2,Exactly. More trustworthy than Tether and decent yields.
2023-10-12 19:31:23,Comment,2,"In the grand scheme of things, $3m is really nothing. The potential is huge!"
2023-10-12 13:06:32,Comment,2,I guess one can‚Äôt have freedom and decentralization on one side and market visibility and relevance as well on the other.
2023-10-12 12:33:05,Comment,3,Most likely scenario
2023-10-12 12:31:03,Comment,1,There must have been reasons‚Ä¶ it is a shame though.
2023-10-12 12:30:06,Comment,1,"Watching Bricks and Moons pump while Donuts kind of crab along is pretty sad. Come on guys, you can do it too!"
2023-10-12 12:28:56,Comment,1,My ETH buying average would sink!
2023-10-11 20:46:29,Comment,1,"I‚Äôm so waiting for the moment I will finally be able to actually have something to show for years of efforts, saving, chart-induced stress, and doubting myself at every move."
2023-10-11 18:19:10,Comment,1,"Yeah, I did. The issue was that I didn‚Äôt add the Gnosis network to my MetaMask"
2023-10-11 12:23:54,Comment,2,"I totally agree. Only problem is, one side has the US behind them..."
2023-10-11 11:19:20,Comment,3,Thank you! That‚Äôs the bit I was missing!

2023-10-11 08:50:45,Comment,1,"Mine are not showing either. But it's weird, because next to the names of people who wrote that they received them it also says ""0"" donuts."

2023-10-10 21:18:23,Comment,0,I didn't get any. Is there any way to check whether I have earned any in the first place?
2023-10-10 18:06:40,Comment,3,"My DCA is pretty happy, thank you very much."
2023-10-10 12:36:24,Comment,1,DCAing into SOL at these prices makes a lot of sense
2023-10-10 09:59:29,Comment,1,"I love crypto history. Sure, it‚Äôs full of failures and swindles, but to see comments like this warms the heart"
2023-10-09 12:46:30,Comment,1,"If their policies don‚Äôt mess up, they will the crypto world soon enough."
2023-10-08 13:24:39,Comment,1,Still the best piece of advice though
