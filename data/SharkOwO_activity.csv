2023-10-23 19:12:39,Comment,2,"Being new here, Dont know who is who. But as far as mods support. I put trust in them. As they know better. Also as a person, anyone who comes clear on public ground needs a chance. And should be give a chance. Kicking out anyone without a warning or clearing out any misunderstanding would show how Inflexible are they.   
I believe how the Mods took this matter was very professional. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
2023-10-23 18:31:24,Comment,1,So basically its a bear of hope climbing to be bull.. Not bad.

And its was really hard to bring her on the grounds of agreeing that this is a real currency. But as it isn't backed by any physical asset or government, sadly she still doesn't trust this system due to its uncertainty."

2023-10-22 17:18:16,Comment,1,Its sad indeed. It's time for companies to relocate who offers crypto so they dont go in loss. Then continue with lawsuit. Even though pretty sure lawsuit wont help as its IMF.
