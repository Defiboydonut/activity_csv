2023-10-28 09:23:45,Comment,1,I don’t think it will take long before we are back at a couple of cents per donut.
2023-10-28 09:22:59,Comment,3,I think we already have the spotlight. There’s no point in even holding moons at the moment with such uncertainty.
2023-10-28 09:19:41,Comment,1,!myactivity
2023-10-27 18:23:53,Comment,2,Of course LINK starts to go up as soon as I start buying it
2023-10-27 15:41:10,Comment,2,I definitely agree with you. People were even making second accounts and personas just to make more moons!
2023-10-27 15:30:23,Comment,1,"Let’s be honest though, we get these tokens for completely free. Why take such a gamble with moons when you don’t even know if they will exist a week from now?"
2023-10-27 15:28:38,Comment,1,"Probably just whales trying to sell for a nicer price, or just degens."
2023-10-27 15:27:56,Comment,2,They are probably already here
2023-10-27 15:27:27,Comment,3,They have become the very thing we swore to destroy lol.
2023-10-26 20:33:33,Comment,2,Self autonomy in this sub is what we should be aiming for.
2023-10-26 20:32:44,Comment,4,"“Your honour, my client was in a goofy mood”"
2023-10-26 20:26:12,Comment,1,And it shows just how many comments were crap.
2023-10-26 20:24:54,Comment,4,We don’t need Reddit where we are going
2023-10-26 20:23:34,Comment,5,"Open source is always the way to go, things like today show us today that we have a bunch of potential."
2023-10-26 20:22:39,Comment,3,It’s really awesome that you guys are putting so much time into this!
2023-10-25 11:04:54,Comment,2,"38k bitcoin sounds surreal. The bear market really has left a mark.

Hopefully ETH gets some action too."
2023-10-25 11:03:24,Comment,2,There’s not gonna be a moon distribution this month because of Reddit being Reddit.
2023-10-25 11:02:52,Comment,4,If ETF approval happens before the end of the year then there’s no reason why ETH won’t go up.
2023-10-25 09:59:31,Comment,2,"I doubt I’ll get enough donuts this month for that, but I am also looking forward to being able to nominate."
2023-10-24 19:49:45,Comment,2,"I doubt they are going to regret much, but we will be fine."
2023-10-24 19:49:13,Comment,5,The government are probably rubbing their hands together with all of that tax money!
2023-10-24 09:55:17,Comment,2,"I agree with what you are saying. Other than liquidity, centralisation of assets could mean a decrease in prices.

Stocks for example, are bought through brokers who charge fees. If stocks could somehow become tokenised, surely a decentralised stock exchange would have fees that are much less."
2023-10-24 09:51:52,Comment,2,Definitely. Prices will probably go back down in the short term but ETF approval will mean a change in sentiment.
2023-10-24 09:51:05,Comment,2,I think my Granny would be very confused if she discovered a nuclear war on her bingo card.
2023-10-24 09:43:33,Comment,3,You are getting in at a great time!
2023-10-24 09:42:56,Comment,3,We are in Q4 right now so perhaps the prophecy will be fulfilled.
2023-10-24 09:41:03,Comment,3,"As much as I love this pump, I really don’t see it being sustained unless we get official confirmation of an ETF today."
2023-10-24 09:37:34,Comment,1,"Yeah, starting with subs that actually want it is most important. If there is demand from r/ethereum or r/bitcoin then we could move from there."
2023-10-24 07:38:36,Comment,3,"The trading volume for the whole market has increased by 127% in the last 24 hours to $83 billion.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/)"
2023-10-23 22:54:09,Comment,1,It will probably be formally announced this week. Just don’t tell Coindesk.
2023-10-23 22:53:11,Comment,1,It very well could. I was on my phone 5 minutes ago at $32k and now it’s at $33k!
2023-10-23 19:57:46,Comment,1,I would take a week of Mondays if they all looked like this one.
2023-10-23 19:57:11,Comment,0,Our optimism has paid off.
2023-10-23 13:01:35,Comment,2,It’s really cool how only a few thousand dollars can buy you THAT many donuts.
2023-10-23 12:57:52,Comment,2,He must be one of the lucky ones!
2023-10-23 12:57:40,Comment,1,Just so we could get back to where we were :/
2023-10-23 11:47:24,Comment,3,"It will definitely be worse than last month, but it won’t be that bad."
2023-10-23 11:04:16,Comment,1,Could this be a bank? Or some other big fund?
2023-10-23 11:03:56,Comment,2,"Definitely ETH, come on now."
2023-10-20 10:34:09,Comment,8,I love how the sub Reddit flipping has happened. There are more comments on this daily than in the r/cc one.
2023-10-18 19:11:49,Comment,4,I seen a post speculating that a wallet address was selling 500 moons every few minutes since the announcement. Many people said that it is likely to be an exchange.
2023-10-18 19:08:11,Comment,4,"Yeah this sub can be extremely informative at times. I do think a large part of that is due to this sub not having as large of a profit incentive as moons does. Here, you can help people out and not expect a reward, which makes helping even more worthwhile."
2023-10-18 19:05:28,Comment,3,How so?
2023-10-18 19:05:10,Comment,4,"I love how donuts were here long before the other RCPs, and now they survive after the others have died."
2023-10-18 19:03:32,Comment,2,Donuts and bronuts for life!
2023-10-18 19:03:08,Comment,2,I do agree that blatantly wrong comments or posts should be downvoted (that's what the button is for!) but trying to manipulate the karma ratio singlehandedly is bizarre.
2023-10-18 15:36:09,Comment,1,Yeah we are down a lot from news that didn’t even concern donuts lol. I think donuts will have to do a lot of work to even think about achieving highs.
2023-10-18 15:35:23,Comment,2,The more the merrier I guess
2023-10-18 15:34:45,Comment,1,"It’s at 82 now, we will definitely hit it by the end of the night."
2023-10-18 15:33:53,Comment,3,"Ah well, we have the bot to tell us our karma."
2023-10-18 09:39:08,Comment,6,"Not to drag on Ethereum but you do have a point. The only TRULY decentralised cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which is why it is worth so much."
2023-10-18 09:12:52,Comment,4,A bad cake day for you then.
2023-10-18 09:11:51,Comment,1,"It’s actually valuable that donuts are truly decentralised. Sure, Reddit could just press a button and delete the sub but they don’t fully control donuts (unlike another few coins I know)."
2023-10-17 18:41:26,Comment,2,The longer you are in this space the sooner you realise that BTC is the only thing you should own.
2023-10-17 18:40:59,Comment,2,This is a very interesting turn of events lol
2023-10-17 18:28:01,Comment,5,"I haven’t seen kirtash or meeleen in either sub yet, nevermind the bigger holders. Poor guys"
2023-10-17 18:25:26,Comment,7,Time for the great migration from r/cc then.
2023-10-17 18:24:07,Comment,6,"It’s so sad man. The community has just been fucked. Maybe there is some big reason why they can’t have them anymore, but it wouldn’t have hurt just to leave them alone."
2023-10-17 18:23:28,Comment,7,The real strategy is to sell all of your moons for donuts now.
2023-10-17 15:07:00,Comment,1,Especially when SBF is involved lol
2023-10-17 13:03:53,Comment,1,Pumptober is in full effect it seems.
2023-10-17 11:41:21,Comment,4,Wife changing losses are also a possibility
2023-10-17 11:40:57,Comment,2,It always does once we are in a bear market. I wonder if this next bull market might change things and we start to see less dominance.
2023-10-17 09:59:15,Comment,2,At least if we hit ATHs again you will be in big profits.
2023-10-17 09:58:32,Comment,3,Hopium is a rare thing at this point.
2023-10-17 09:35:32,Comment,3,"I think it’s funny how he thinks they are too centralised, yet crypto is too decentralised!"
2023-10-17 08:40:46,Comment,2,His hardware doesn't matter. Bro is going to cook regardless.
2023-10-17 08:39:55,Comment,3,Good morning Bronuts. Do you think there will be anymore ETF drama today?
2023-10-16 18:50:46,Comment,2,This made me laugh
2023-10-16 18:50:28,Comment,1,Plus the stock market is basically near ATHs yet a recession is apparently right around the corner.
2023-10-16 18:41:58,Comment,2,They are sorry for manipulating the market lol
2023-10-16 15:30:34,Comment,1,You passed the test.
2023-10-16 15:30:16,Comment,2,At least you guys are having fun.
2023-10-16 15:19:00,Comment,2,Centralised companies don't seem to work well with decentralised products.
2023-10-16 15:18:29,Comment,1,"They just have to prove that a long position was his. He could have done it though an associate, but that can be proven with time."
2023-10-16 15:17:48,Comment,3,"Due to this dull bear, I forgot just how exciting this market can really get."
2023-10-16 15:17:12,Comment,1,"I doubt it was them to be honest. That would be extremely obvious, and therefore dumb, if it was."
2023-10-16 13:02:59,Comment,3,He definitely isn’t biased lol
2023-10-16 09:00:23,Comment,1,"That’s a great idea for tipping, cant believe I hadn’t thought of that."
2023-10-16 08:59:01,Comment,2,I think it is. I was struggling to load it yesterday and so were others.
2023-10-16 08:33:48,Comment,3,"Hell yeah, realistically it could be another year before the next bull run, if not longer."
2023-10-16 08:31:04,Comment,4,"Something I like to think of is how big this sub will get once the bull market comes, especially because ETH is likely to do well this bull.

More user's means more demand for donuts too ;)"
2023-10-16 08:30:11,Comment,1,Donuts will show these big coins what's up.
2023-10-16 08:29:11,Comment,4,"If it does that before, then what price will ETH get to during the bull run?"
2023-10-16 08:28:43,Comment,3,I feel like it is our turn now.
2023-10-16 08:28:30,Comment,1,Thank you bot.
2023-10-16 08:02:57,Comment,1,They are busy with all of the bears.
2023-10-16 08:02:05,Comment,3,And I hope that it is well done too.
2023-10-16 07:04:59,Comment,3,"When a hacker finally breaches my wallet, only to find 0.0001 ETH"
2023-10-16 07:04:13,Comment,4,And when the come in the bull market they are only exit liquidity.
2023-10-15 17:54:59,Comment,2,This is just bad news for RCPs. The only one for a sub that is not crypto related is struggling.
2023-10-15 17:33:41,Comment,3,"Oh definitely. Hell, even if we only catch up to moons or bricks it still is a crazy gain."
2023-10-15 17:32:29,Comment,6,Now all we need is to be able to buy them with donuts!
2023-10-15 16:32:28,Comment,1,The whale has spoken.
2023-10-15 16:31:54,Comment,2,Rule number 0 is to not be a crypto bro
2023-10-15 16:31:39,Comment,2,I was struggling to load it earlier.
2023-10-15 15:52:24,Comment,2,That seems inevitable at this point.
2023-10-15 15:51:56,Comment,2,"Yeah I like gnosis too, although it is confusing that you can use either gnosis or mainnet."
2023-10-15 15:50:55,Comment,1,"If anything, 2025 will be crazier."
2023-10-15 14:51:13,Comment,2,Selling near the top (at either side) is just as good.
2023-10-15 14:50:21,Comment,2,Governments hate that you can't just make money out of air with ETH
2023-10-15 13:58:54,Comment,5,"I have never been around for a coin that pumps a lot in a short period of time, that then stays at the price. It always dumps."
2023-10-15 13:24:24,Comment,1,"No Kirtash it was a typo, I meant $30k."
2023-10-15 13:23:41,Comment,2,We aren’t a cult 😅
2023-10-15 12:54:57,Comment,1,One of us...
2023-10-15 12:54:27,Comment,5,Where do you guys buy your donuts?
2023-10-15 12:53:53,Comment,2,All we need is Kraken to pull through and get us that listing!
2023-10-15 12:53:28,Comment,2,"I think we can get there, but baby steps first lol"
2023-10-15 12:53:03,Comment,3,What will that entail?
2023-10-15 12:52:27,Comment,3,People will think you are crazy until you tell them about donuts.
2023-10-15 12:51:18,Comment,1,"Time to start stacking up donuts I suppose.

The fact that people still own Dogelon Mars in 2023 is beyond me."
2023-10-15 11:42:47,Comment,2,I feel like this happens to us all at some point.
2023-10-15 10:09:59,Comment,2,That is how it is. If you don't believe in the future of crypto you will miss out on the next bull market.
2023-10-15 10:09:08,Comment,2,"Ah well, at least he stepped away with 6 figures. A lot more than most people."
2023-10-15 10:08:32,Comment,2,Nice
2023-10-15 10:07:33,Comment,3,Stack them bags!
2023-10-15 10:07:19,Comment,5,Just a matter of time until we get to $10k ETH.
2023-10-15 10:06:31,Comment,3,"Meanwhile Satoshi is just chilling somewhere, he doesn't want any beef!"
2023-10-15 10:05:41,Comment,1,Why?
2023-10-14 19:29:56,Comment,1,At least we aren't stuck at 69 upvotes.
2023-10-14 19:29:28,Comment,1,I have been sick this weekend too but staying on here is keeping me sane.
2023-10-14 19:28:31,Comment,1,!donut
2023-10-14 19:27:33,Comment,2,I swear the comedy posts just keep getting better and better.
2023-10-14 19:26:56,Comment,2,The FOMO has just begun...
2023-10-14 14:56:57,Comment,3,Turning 5 minute shits into 30 minute shits!
2023-10-14 14:56:36,Comment,4,It is rainy and cold here so the Saturday vibes aren't Saturdaying
2023-10-14 13:10:45,Comment,2,There have been rumours that Twitter will implement something very similar. Nothing has happened yet but it would be great if it did.
2023-10-14 13:10:10,Comment,1,Your life.
2023-10-14 13:09:31,Comment,3,You are a donut whale! At least that is something!
2023-10-14 13:09:03,Comment,3,Who the fuck is buying these NFTs lol
2023-10-14 12:18:48,Comment,1,"If donuts were $1, how many more would you need to buy a Ferrari?"
2023-10-14 12:18:18,Comment,2,"Just seen a post on Reddit about this, going to make it a habit from now on."
2023-10-14 12:17:47,Comment,2,I put it into my veins and I have unfortunately overdosed.
2023-10-14 12:17:02,Comment,2,"This is really true. If you believe in the long term success of ETH, then just buy now."
2023-10-14 11:10:04,Comment,1,Sold to us for exit liquidity 😎
2023-10-14 11:09:38,Comment,2,You will never know…
2023-10-13 21:21:11,Comment,2,Right now I am a crab.
2023-10-13 21:19:21,Comment,1,I can’t imagine it’s that great.
2023-10-13 21:18:33,Comment,3,RCPs are making all the difference right now.
2023-10-13 16:09:03,Comment,1,Comments today have been ***very*** slow. What gives?
2023-10-13 16:06:55,Comment,4,Thank god the IRS is only in America.
2023-10-13 13:37:22,Comment,1,Staying involved with the community is a really great decision. I know for me that I was able to get in early on a few coins because of it.
2023-10-13 13:36:06,Comment,2,"I like the slow days sometimes, it is easier to keep up with the daily."
2023-10-13 13:35:37,Comment,2,"I’m really not sure. It is kind of a messed up situation as they are properly pumping and dumped it, then banning people who call them out."
2023-10-12 15:26:38,Comment,2,It is impressive that our coin seems so robust.
2023-10-12 15:26:07,Comment,3,Plus the vibes here are simply better.
2023-10-12 15:25:43,Comment,2,For sure it is. You just have to talk about the tech when people ask you.
2023-10-12 15:25:17,Comment,2,Shots fired!
2023-10-12 15:14:01,Comment,3,Take my karma friend and get some more
2023-10-12 14:49:54,Comment,1,Oof. Sucks to be a whale /s
2023-10-12 10:55:58,Comment,2,When the numbers are green people just don't care about the actual numbers lol
2023-10-12 10:55:23,Comment,2,"They did it all for greed, and now they are doing all of this to save their own skin."
2023-10-12 10:54:49,Comment,3,"But once both are big market cap coins, both will have higher prices."
2023-10-12 10:33:50,Comment,3,"Oof, even more FUD for Binance; except this is true!"
2023-10-12 10:32:05,Comment,2,"Well if ETH grows that much, the entire market will also follow the same trend. So if donuts are around by then (they will be) then you could be right."
2023-10-12 10:31:23,Comment,3,"Which is sad but I don't think I would take part in it. I like tipping RCPs because I know I can earn them, but with gold I have to buy it with my own money which sucks."
2023-10-12 10:30:29,Comment,4,Was Binance rumoured to be doing this?
2023-10-12 10:29:26,Comment,2,It is a really good idea. Do you play it on PC?
2023-10-12 10:28:26,Comment,6,In my opinion this is **very** bullish for crypto. Big partnerships like this will make all the difference to onboard people.
2023-10-11 16:17:46,Comment,1,Are you on the right network?
2023-10-11 13:03:58,Comment,2,And I thought it would only be bad news today…
2023-10-11 13:02:00,Comment,3,They used to hate it and now they love it (as long as they control it)
2023-10-10 14:20:26,Comment,3,A small donut tip never hurt either.
2023-10-10 14:20:07,Comment,2,They are not going to like what they see when the next distro hits...
2023-10-10 14:19:39,Comment,3,"I doubt we could prove who came up with it, more of a community idea than anything else."
2023-10-10 14:19:10,Comment,3,We have each other's back ;)
2023-10-10 14:18:38,Comment,5,"0.2% doesn't seem like much, but deflation is still deflation."
2023-10-10 14:18:06,Comment,2,It definitely is not a bad thing. They are a business at the end of the day.
2023-10-09 08:35:31,Comment,2,And are the bad quality upvotes just getting lucky?
2023-10-09 08:27:18,Comment,3,No!
2023-10-09 08:26:50,Comment,2,"I don't think I will make any big buys or sells this week, time to keep HODLing!"
2023-10-08 21:14:54,Comment,2,*ptsd also enters the chat*
2023-10-08 21:14:38,Comment,5,It has been on 69 upvotes for hours now.
2023-10-08 17:24:24,Comment,3,"Oh I see what you mean. That’s very true. 

Well if manipulation like that is happening, it is difficult to have an alt as Reddit can see that both accounts have the same IP address."
2023-10-08 17:19:12,Comment,3,Is it possible to actually tell who is doing the downvoting though? I don’t think mods have access to that info.
2023-10-08 17:18:05,Comment,2,I am thankful that I did not succumb to the FOMO
2023-10-08 17:17:01,Comment,2,"The weather has been great recently, although it is strange how warm it is in October."
2023-10-08 17:10:39,Comment,1,"They don’t invest, they speculate. They only want someone else to buy it at a higher price so that they can sell their bag for profit."
2023-10-08 17:10:03,Comment,1,You and me bronut.
2023-10-08 17:09:47,Comment,2,Going outside for walks everyday (even if they are short) is a must for me.
2023-10-08 17:09:10,Comment,1,I have not interacted with any :(
2023-10-08 17:08:36,Comment,2,Things like this are what makes this community so special.
2023-10-08 17:08:14,Comment,1,We appreciate you!
2023-10-08 13:17:39,Comment,2,"They are just holding instead. 

I do think we should be worth at least as much as moons though."
2023-10-08 13:17:08,Comment,2,"A really great classic movie that I love is the original planet of the apes movie, the one that released in the 60s."
2023-10-08 13:16:24,Comment,2,I love how people suddenly become experts when things like this happen.
2023-10-08 13:15:59,Comment,1,Exactly! What are the advantages of AVAX over ETH?
2023-10-08 13:15:13,Comment,3,You never know where any of us are or what jobs we have…
2023-10-08 13:14:41,Comment,2,Yet if we all buy regularly a lot of us already have experienced the lows of this market.
2023-10-08 13:13:42,Comment,5,"I read a very anti-crypto article today on the FT discussing the amount of fraud that crypto allows. 

This narrative falls through the floor when you see articles like this."
2023-10-08 12:22:24,Comment,1,I don’t think it is possible to truly learn without some sort of financial pain.
2023-10-08 11:56:57,Comment,2,Never involve your emotions with your crypto.
2023-10-08 11:56:31,Comment,2,100%. I feel like it is sad that so many people are desperate for these things.
2023-10-08 11:48:38,Comment,2,"We always knew that it was going to be low in a bear market. 

Things are being developed and the ecosystem is being improved everyday, so hopefully things will be a lot better in the bull market."
2023-10-08 11:43:50,Comment,1,"You can tell because the ai likes to order things in bullet points or numbers, so as soon as people see that they accuse."
2023-10-08 11:38:55,Comment,1,All donut bros are welcome in donut land.
2023-10-08 11:38:26,Comment,2,"I always get times when I feel unsure about owning crypto, usually after reading an article bashing it or something."
2023-10-08 10:33:24,Comment,1,I used to be that degen. Hopefully I have become better.
2023-10-08 10:32:41,Comment,3,Poor Vitalik must have paid a ridiculous amount of gas by now.
2023-10-07 20:52:12,Comment,2,I think if we get close to $0.50 I would be very tempted.
2023-10-07 20:51:28,Comment,3,Have you come to any new revelations about crypto?
2023-10-07 20:50:36,Comment,3,This is the Gwei
2023-10-07 20:08:00,Comment,3,100% ;)
2023-10-07 17:44:55,Comment,1,"Yet there will be less volume due to the smaller amount of holders, and probably a lower price too.

If we want donuts to really succeed, we need a lot more holders."
2023-10-07 17:44:00,Comment,2,"I would too. Legally, does that mean you are forgiven for hacking?"
2023-10-07 17:43:21,Comment,1,"They rewarded the hacker as losing a little bit of it is always preferable to losing all of it.

They will be able to prevent this security breach in the future."
2023-10-07 17:42:40,Comment,2,All we need now is our tinfoil hats.
2023-10-07 17:41:46,Comment,1,"The UK and Europe have seemed to lag the US by a few months when it has come to inflation and then with interest rates.

As for whether we have had a soft landing, I don't think we have seen the worst of what will happen. I don't think firms and mortgage holders will be able to hold on much longer with how interest rates are, we could see a lot more trouble by the end of this year."
2023-10-07 17:38:31,Comment,1,"I don't think bricks ever stood a chance. There is much less interest in them, compared to moons and donuts."
2023-10-07 13:49:21,Comment,1,"It is strangely warm in Ireland, and has been for a while now, but when the autumn chill hits I will be loading up on some pumpkin spice."
2023-10-07 13:48:32,Comment,2,Although I am yet to see any articles on donuts.
2023-10-07 13:48:00,Comment,2,So we can stress about the price 24/7!
2023-10-07 13:46:22,Comment,3,"Regardless of what the outcome to that would be, reducing the pay2post fee right now would increase post spam, as post would be more profitable.

Keeping it as it is makes posting a 50/50 game, pushing you to increase your quality."
2023-10-07 13:44:36,Comment,1,"It is strange that posts rarely get upvotes, yet comments get a lot."
2023-10-07 13:43:45,Comment,1,Surely just reducing the fee is part of the solution to this?
2023-10-07 13:11:32,Comment,2,That is a lot of ETH!
2023-10-07 13:11:15,Comment,2,"Disposable wallets are great for preventing phishing hacks, which are so common these days."
2023-10-07 13:09:43,Comment,1,"And as long as that building continues, there should not be a problem."
2023-10-07 13:09:07,Comment,1,Holding ETH should be one of the essentials in every portfolio.
2023-10-07 13:08:32,Comment,3,"I hope it does. The risk of becoming centralised is very important, what is the point of using crypto over other currencies if it is centralised?"
2023-10-07 13:05:29,Comment,3,Yet without BTC we would not have a private alternative to CBDCs
2023-10-07 13:04:49,Comment,2,Is this tech titan Elon?
2023-10-06 18:34:02,Comment,3,"u/kirtash93 has spoken, it must be true."
2023-10-06 17:35:18,Comment,2,"It is terrifying, AI art can get creepy sometimes."
2023-10-06 14:07:53,Comment,2,Similar functions that promote and reward quality contributions can only ever be a good thing.
2023-10-06 14:06:35,Comment,1,"I hope they do. I doubt it will be the entire amount, but at least some would be great."
2023-10-06 09:14:02,Comment,2,Just be careful not to get burnt!
2023-10-05 17:41:13,Comment,2,Donut NFTs?
2023-10-05 17:40:56,Comment,1,"Very true, not being able to retire would be very frustrating."
2023-10-05 17:40:13,Comment,2,Donut cost average is brilliant. I am going to start using that from now on.
2023-10-05 17:39:01,Comment,2,I think a financial crash could happen. Not as big as 2008 but still substantial.
2023-10-05 17:38:31,Comment,2,What use cases do you have in mind?
2023-10-05 17:37:44,Comment,1,"They’re not wrong, making money in your younger years is difficult. Plus, spending when you are young is better as you are fitter and have more time on your hands."
2023-10-05 17:25:16,Comment,3,When are they not red?
2023-10-05 17:25:04,Comment,2,Time in the market is always better than timing the market. Pick a plan and buy regularly and you’ll be sweet.
2023-10-05 17:24:35,Comment,2,And a great time to be earning some!
2023-10-05 17:23:46,Comment,2,You tell em’ Matt.
2023-10-05 17:23:22,Comment,2,"I know that MEXC was a big early adopter of moons, before Kraken even. I think it could be a good idea."
2023-10-05 10:22:29,Comment,3,"The sub does seem slow these days, so maybe not as low as that."
2023-10-05 10:22:03,Comment,3,"Definitely not soon, but in 10 years? Maybe."
2023-10-05 10:21:33,Comment,3,Why wait when you can accumulate now?
2023-10-05 10:20:40,Comment,3,Buying at a good price is always a good feeling! I still think we could be at around this point for a long while to come.
2023-10-05 10:19:49,Comment,2,"Investors can't just keep ignoring the gains in the crypto market, at some point they would become involved."
2023-10-05 10:19:02,Comment,3,"Me too, it seemed to me that Coinbase would be a lot more likely to win this."
2023-10-05 10:18:17,Comment,3,I collab with Dunkin Donuts every weekend ;)
2023-10-03 11:03:09,Comment,3,We are the best though.
2023-10-03 10:08:50,Comment,1,"I have a small bag of SOL, and I think it definitely will go up over the next few years. Will it hit $200 again though? I am not sure."
2023-10-03 10:08:09,Comment,3,Yeah I would say it is. Does your bank block crypto payments?
2023-10-03 10:07:38,Comment,3,"This is my second one, yet I am still as excited."
2023-10-03 10:07:08,Comment,4,America is about to give freedom to all of this ETH gas.
2023-10-03 08:13:10,Comment,1,We can at least 10x and get to where moons are.
2023-10-03 08:12:52,Comment,3,Will the distribution for tipping users be on the same day as the main karma distribution?
2023-10-02 17:54:11,Comment,2,I have done my part!
2023-10-02 17:53:50,Comment,2,Why not?
2023-10-02 17:53:06,Comment,0,Or maybe sell.
2023-10-02 17:52:48,Comment,3,I think Grayscale is in the top 10 largets ETH holders.
2023-10-02 17:52:15,Comment,6,"Someone tipped 0.1 BTC ($0.14 at the time), holy shit!"

2023-10-02 15:48:08,Comment,5,That's what she said.
2023-10-02 10:14:14,Comment,3,"56 upvotes for the daily already, today is going to be crazy."
2023-10-01 17:15:15,Comment,2,And then the price will start going up too ;)
2023-10-01 17:14:49,Comment,2,"They always appear after the snapshot, perhaps trying to manipulate the ratio already?"

2023-10-01 17:11:03,Comment,2,"Polls are fun.

I agree that spot ETFs will be huge, but that isn't to say that a futures ETF will be insignificant."

Hopefully this is a sign of more things to come in pumptober."
2023-10-01 14:17:59,Comment,1,I responded to them and now my wallets and bank accounts have been drained. Did I do something wrong?
2023-10-01 10:07:38,Comment,1,Hopefully that is actually achievable though.
2023-10-01 10:06:04,Comment,2,"Perhaps, maybe the snapshot has brought people back."
2023-10-01 10:05:41,Comment,2,You are always going to see that. I feel like the comments on new posts are especially low effort.

2023-10-01 10:03:58,Comment,2,We could put on our tinfoil hats and imagine that the mother was behind it this whole time.
