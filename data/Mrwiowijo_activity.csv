2023-10-20 10:38:25,Comment,"Moons prices fell because the value was like that, for some reason it didn't go to $0 after yesterday's drama. 

Moons initially had no value, it was the ccip that provided the value (hold 75% and liquidity) and the ToS was changed. 

I don't know why m*ds sell before and after the news, if they care about the community huh... Remember they said it was a governance token, right?

 Gluttony, greed, echo chamber buy low sell high, moon farming makes the quality of content like a parrot that squawks that's all (dca hodl, ramen, legacy bitcoin posts) and serial downvoters (I'm sure this is brought by several teams, not just one team only) 

People get downvoted for writing conflicting arguments, get shouted at by fud, then it becomes fake engagement moons to $10 with hopium market cap low, binance listing, cb listing, good morning good night fiat mining.

I saw random people being permabanned 2 days before the snapshot, wow those m*ds must have felt happy because they gave punishment on the last day of their hope of getting Moons.

 I don't know why people are sad because moons prices are going down? Yes, because the 75% chip hold rule makes prices seem high. At least some of you can still make a profit from it while on the sub. I forgot the ratio but redd*t got 50%, community 40%, m*ds 10% (lmao) is already a red flag.



New project Moons 2.0? Goodluck then, do you believe m*ds (who don't sell) will maintain the project? Be aware my cryptobros 

Yeah I hope this sub doesn't turn out like that.",2
