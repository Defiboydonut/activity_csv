And the thing is karma is actually upvote minus downvote. 
But donut allocation for media/comedy post is 10%. So that's now like multiplier but infact a seperate reserve for that."

2023-11-18 06:17:30,Comment,1,I think the reddito's normal karma data is correct as it's been published few days ago. It's the tip data which has something off
