2023-10-27 20:34:03,Comment,1,I've being going back and forth in my head about whether to do this. I think it's the fact that this makes it more of a permanent loss is what's been stopping me. I might just remove half of it and ride the waves with the rest.
2023-10-27 20:27:39,Comment,1,I've learnt my lesson
2023-10-27 20:22:57,Comment,2,"I didn't understand impermanent loss until reddit ""sunsetting event"". I was providing liquidity for Donut /ETH on uniswap and now I have way more donuts and less ETH but worth less even with the staking rewards."
2023-10-27 20:10:31,Comment,2,I've never bought Matic but I received 1000usdt rewards on MM . Shame you can remove it from your wallet - sometimes I worry I might click on it by mistake.
2023-10-27 20:05:27,Comment,3,"My friend who I tried to introduce to RCPs just found out about the ""reddit sunsetting thing"". I'm now a meme and I don't know where to hide."
2023-10-27 19:58:10,Comment,7,Exactly this - people are just being impatient. Distro used to take longer even with ruggit providing the CSV. Keep calm!

2023-10-27 13:22:43,Comment,2,I've got a bit of time today - we can do this!
2023-10-27 13:02:08,Comment,2,Exactly - time is money I suppose and some would rather spend it elsewhere for the time being. I Just hope they are not the ones buying moons lol
2023-10-27 12:58:39,Comment,2,"Well, enjoy the tranquility until then"
2023-10-27 12:52:17,Comment,5,"Another slow daily but the upside is there is less bronut talk. I think once the distribution is done, we will see people coming back."
2023-10-27 11:52:40,Comment,2,"As much as this is not great on so many levels - I think the message they are trying to get across is if you are criminal thinking you can hide your money in crypto, UK is not for you. They already have the power to seize cash or property acquired through criminal activities. Why should crypto be different? 

Just my 2 cents."
2023-10-26 22:42:01,Comment,1,I think you need a reddit avatar as your DP but I might be wrong.
2023-10-26 19:11:29,Comment,1,Ignorance is no defence - he should just plead guilty and save us the drama.
2023-10-26 19:07:15,Comment,2,"![img](avatar_exp|147807711|clown)

Me after slagging ruggit off but still using it."
2023-10-26 17:51:14,Comment,1,You and me both - my limited skills when it comes to database would never.
2023-10-26 11:44:30,Comment,2,!tip 1 DONUT
2023-10-26 10:15:04,Comment,2,1 would still give you a good amount of donuts - well done sir
2023-10-26 09:54:41,Comment,3,Weird how I found LivingFondant's before I could find mine
2023-10-26 07:37:25,Comment,3,"Unfortunately, there are some people out there who still think SBF has done nothing wrong."
2023-10-26 07:08:00,Comment,1,Damn! That quite a drop
2023-10-26 07:05:17,Comment,1,This made me lol in the office
2023-10-26 06:52:42,Comment,2,They are not even trying to pretend they feel any remorse for what they did.
2023-10-26 06:45:53,Comment,1,The donuts complement the vibes
2023-10-26 06:33:01,Comment,3,I think people are disappointed snapshot is taking longer than usual
2023-10-26 06:30:18,Comment,2,Top of the morning to you Bronuts.. ETH looks like it's allergic to $2K
2023-10-24 11:45:17,Comment,1,I hope so for the sake of my ETH bag
2023-10-24 11:13:05,Comment,2,I only see 43
2023-10-24 11:11:50,Comment,1,"60/40 for me but BTC is up 50% while ETH is at 20%.
Hopefully it won't be long before ETH catches up."
2023-10-24 11:07:05,Comment,2,I feel like a proud parent watching ETH trying to keep up with BTC. Still way behind in terms of %yearly return but I've got my nuts crossed.
2023-10-20 15:52:11,Comment,0,"I think we need to start limiting these posts - we get it, the cc MODs who sold can join reddit and go suck a big one. 

Bronuts unite!!"
2023-10-20 15:36:48,Comment,2,Anyone else receive an email from kraken about a free- William's racing NFT?
2023-10-20 15:33:24,Comment,1,This is pretty cool - welcome to the good side bronuts
2023-10-20 13:56:15,Comment,5,What happens if one person decides the want to fuck you over or dies?
2023-10-20 13:48:17,Comment,2,60% of my portfolio but BTC doing better overall
2023-10-20 13:19:02,Comment,1,Some green to lighten the mood after reddit rug.
2023-10-20 13:17:57,Comment,6,There seems to be a lot of ETH Fud from Bitcoin maxis - is there something they know that we don't or just shilling BTC.
2023-10-20 07:56:19,Comment,2,I provide liquidity on uniswap and started with 20k donuts. Staked them and earning around 42 donuts a day - was 55 when I started a month ago. I have less ETH now donuts have tanked but I'm here to support the community. Read on impermanent loss though.
2023-10-18 14:15:09,Comment,1,Good to see the traffic on this sub - they say in crypto expect the unexpected but no one saw this coming. Donuts for the win.
2023-10-07 15:11:19,Comment,2,Big fat NO - I think y'all are trying to do too much with this. Donuts are rewards to encourage engagement and charging people to do it is not a way to grow the community. Just my 2cents.
2023-10-07 09:32:00,Comment,1,DONcember
2023-10-07 09:04:00,Comment,1,ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚  what did he do? Must have been serious
2023-10-07 08:55:06,Comment,2,It's a shame though that some people have their mind made up about how crypto is evil and nothing anybody can say will change their mind.
2023-10-07 08:46:25,Comment,4,Has anyone managed to convince someone else who doesn't know much about crypto to join the sub? I tried explaining to a friend who spends a lot of time on other subs but they thought it was too good to be true.
2023-10-06 16:56:21,Comment,2,"In terms of longterm investment, I would say yes. BTC has outperformed everything else on my portfolio including ETH but I have high hope's for a flippening."
2023-10-06 13:25:40,Comment,2,Forgive us - we were on a high dose of hopium and we now  realise  how wrong we were.
2023-10-05 23:24:04,Comment,5,Our day will come - we just have to be patient
2023-10-05 23:04:43,Comment,3,I think I'll scoop some more at this price
2023-10-05 23:02:02,Comment,4,Welcome to the new daily - buy the dip!
2023-10-05 22:56:38,Comment,3,It's really good to see the community grow.. we've come a long way!
2023-10-05 22:42:02,Comment,3,Damn! Nearly 5k comments on the daily
2023-10-04 12:53:22,Comment,2,Success!! I realized I used low gas fees on the initial transaction and needed to replace it.
2023-10-04 10:43:01,Comment,1,Thanks - I'll give it another try
2023-10-04 10:14:34,Comment,2,"Question about staking - I'm providing liquidity on Uniswap and would like to stake this. Do I need to be using the same wallet that I use to receive donuts or can I use a different wallet? I'm stuck at ""stake LP tokens"""
2023-10-03 16:02:50,Comment,1,Amen to that
2023-10-03 15:07:18,Comment,3,"Watching the charts feels like one of those ""and.....you are back in the room"" moment. Where are the gains we were promised?"
2023-09-30 18:40:37,Comment,3,This is pretty cool. Has it been decided whether you can get funding support?
2023-09-30 17:09:51,Comment,1,That would really suck but they probably will eventually.
2023-09-30 16:58:05,Comment,1,All rise!
2023-09-30 16:50:17,Comment,1,I bought some at .05c and still hodling. I don't have a lot of time to spend on here but I'm still supporting the community.
2023-09-30 16:23:06,Comment,3,"Has anyone else bought donuts lately, it looks like every weekend someone drops a couple of ETH on donuts and then sells during the week."
2023-09-30 16:10:54,Comment,1,Not even close. I could have a million dollars in Crypto and still think it wasn't enough.
