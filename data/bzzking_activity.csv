2023-10-25 15:59:55,Comment,2,"Done! I hope this works! It was easier than something I did before which was to write a message to the governor or senator or something. This was so much easier, just input the following:

* Name
* Zipcode
* Email
* Phone Number (optional)
* Check 2 boxes
* Enter ETH or ENS address for a NFT (optional)

So ***easy*** that anyone outside of the USA can probably do this too üòÖ Just a thought!"

2023-10-23 20:03:12,Comment,1,"OOF, that's a very low prediction! I agree, there is definitely market uncertainty and especially with the interest rates going up by EOY, it could be possible that ETH ends the year at <$1,700, but I truly hope it does not go as low as 900-1200 haha.

I'm hopeful ETH will end at 2K+, but regardless 2024 will be an epic year for ETH!"

2023-10-21 13:45:37,Comment,2,"MATIC is a technology platform that enables blockchain networks to connect and scale.

MATIC is used to govern and secure the Polygon network and to pay network transaction fees.

MATIC had fast transaction speed and low transaction fees. You can swap to other tokens or coins and can be used as currency also. Many marketplaces accept MATIC, including OpenSea.

The #1 use case for MATIC is to buy more Ethereum. Goodnight!"

2023-10-10 16:16:57,Comment,2,"Exactly. You can hold and hope the impermanent loss goes back to 0, but no one can tell the future.

Another option is to provide more into the new LP rate and average out with your initial or older LP rates, then you have a new impermanent loss rate."
