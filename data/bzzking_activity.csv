2023-10-25 15:59:55,Comment,"Done! I hope this works! It was easier than something I did before which was to write a message to the governor or senator or something. This was so much easier, just input the following:

* Name
* Zipcode
* Email
* Phone Number (optional)
* Check 2 boxes
* Enter ETH or ENS address for a NFT (optional)

So ***easy*** that anyone outside of the USA can probably do this too üòÖ Just a thought!",2

I'm hopeful ETH will end at 2K+, but regardless 2024 will be an epic year for ETH!",1

2023-10-21 13:45:37,Comment,"MATIC is a technology platform that enables blockchain networks to connect and scale.

MATIC is used to govern and secure the Polygon network and to pay network transaction fees.

MATIC had fast transaction speed and low transaction fees. You can swap to other tokens or coins and can be used as currency also. Many marketplaces accept MATIC, including OpenSea.

The #1 use case for MATIC is to buy more Ethereum. Goodnight!",2
