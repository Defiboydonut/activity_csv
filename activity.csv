Assuming the total market cap of all crypto will be much higher in 2025 than at the 2021's peak if you believe in the 4-year cycle.

Cardano almost hit 100B in 2021

This comment is for those still doubting if RCPs would ever hit $100m, I think at the peak of next cycle it could go north of $500m and that would be X100. 

One of my shitcoins(venus) last cycle did a x100 right after I sold cos I underestimate the market.",4
